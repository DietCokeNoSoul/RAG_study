Abstract
Motivation: Identifying new therapeutic effects for the approved drugs is beneficial for effectively reducing the drug development cost and time. Most of the recent computational methods concentrate on exploiting multiple kinds of information about drugs and disease to predict the candidate associations between drugs and diseases. However, the drug and disease nodes have neighboring topologies with multiple scales, and the previous methods did not fully exploit and deeply integrate these topologies. Results: We present a prediction method, MTRD, to integrate and learn multi-scale neighboring topologies and the attributes of a pair of drug and disease nodes. First, for multiple kinds of drug similarities, multiple drug-disease heterogenous networks are constructed respectively to integrate the similarities and associations related to drugs and diseases. Moreover, each heterogenous network has its specific topology structure, which is helpful for learning the corresponding specific topology representation. We formulate the topology embeddings for each drug node and disease node by random walking on each heterogeneous network, and the embeddings cover the neighboring topologies with different scopes. Since the multi-scale topology embeddings have context relationships, we construct Bidirectional long short-term memory-based module to encode these embeddings and their relationships and learn the neighboring topology representation. We also design the attention mechanisms at feature level and at scale level to obtain the more informative pairwise features and topology embeddings. A module based on multi-layer convolutional networks is constructed to learn the representative attributes of the drug-disease node pair according to their related similarity and association information. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that MTRD achieves the superior performance than several state-of-the-art methods for predicting drug-disease associations. MTRD also retrieves more actual drug-disease associations in the top ranked candidates of the prediction result. Case studies on 5 drugs further demonstrate MTRD’s ability in discovering the potential candidate diseases for the interested drugs.

De novo drug discovery and development involves a lot of expences. It usually requires 10 to 15 years and costs 800 million to 1.5 billion US dollars [1–4]. Drug repositioning identifies new therapeutic effects of drugs approved by regulatory agencies [5–7]. Unlike de novo, repositioned drugs have well-characterized biological effectiveness, safety and pharmacological characteristics, which can shorten the drug development cycle to 6.5 years and reduce the cost to 300 million US dollars [8, 9]. Computational prediction of new therapeutic effects of approved drugs can identify true associations that can be confirmed by further experiments. [10–13]. Previously implemented methods can be broadly divided into three categories. Drugs usually obtain the therapeutic effects by interacting with their target genes. A drug and a disease is more likely to association with each other when they are associated or interacted with more common targets[14]. Therefore, several © The Author 2017.

methods [15–17] concerning the first strategy are based on relevant public targets to infer the propensity for drug-related diseases. Similarly, association propensity can also be evaluated using proteins that are associated with drugs and diseases [18–20]. However, these methods are very limited in discovering drug-disease associations without public genes or proteins. The second strategy is to screen out drug-related candidate diseases by integrating a variety of data, including multiple attributes, similarities, associated targets, and known associations between drugs and diseases. A model based on the kernel function was established to integrate molecular and phenotypic information [21]. Several studies have constructed a heterogeneous network and proposed a method to predict associations by modeling the association information or using random walks [22–24]. Several methods are based on sparse subspace learning[25], matrix factorization with similarity constraints [26] or co-occurrence statistics in the literature [27] to infer candidate drugdisease pairs. However, these methods are rudimentary predictive models and cannot completely explore the deep and complex relationships between drugs and diseases. Recently, several methods based on deep learning were proposed and the prediction performance were further improved. A model based on the Gaussian interaction profile and autoencoder was established to predict drug-related candidate diseases by fusing drug-related similarities and associations [28]. A framework composed of convolutional neural networks and a bidirectional long short-term memory network was established to integrate path information between drug diseases [29]. Additionally, the model of the graph auto-encoder has been applied to the association prediction of drugs and diseases [30]. The topological structure formed by a pair of neighbor nodes of drugs and diseases has many different scales and different information. In other words, a set of onehop neighbor nodes only covers a small and partial topology, whereas a set of two-hop and three-hop nodes covers a larger range of topologies. However, the multi-scale neighbor topology of a node pair is neither extracted by the previous method nor considered. In this article, we propose a new prediction method, MTRD, for learning, capturing, and integrating topological context representations and attribute representations from multiple heterogeneous networks. The contributions of our model can be summarized as follows.
• Three different drug-disease bi-layer networks were constructed for three kinds of drug similarities, which is beneficial for combining diverse connections among drugs and diseases and extracting the specific topology of each network.
• A novel topology embedding strategy based on random walks in each drugdisease network was designed to formulate various topology embeddings with multiple scales. Moreover, each drug-disease network has its specific multi-scale embeddings. • A novel framework was constructed to learn two representations of the drugdisease node pair, where the neighboring topology representation integrates the context relationships among multi-scale topology embeddings, and attribute representation reveals the relationship among pairwise attributes. • Two new attention mechanisms at the feature level and the scale level were established to discriminate the various contributions of pairwise features and multi-scale topology embeddings for drug-disease association prediction, respectively. The improved performance was confirmed by comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, the recall rates in top-ranked candidates, and case studies on five drugs.
2 Materials and methods
Multiple drug-disease heterogeneous networks with different drug similarity connections have been established to facilitate the integration of information on multiple drugs and the relationship between drugs and diseases. We propose a prediction model composed of two branches to predict potential disease candidates for drugs of interest. In the left branch, the topological embedding vectors of the drug and disease nodes are generated by random walks with restarts on multiple heterogeneous networks. A new feature-level attention mechanism was proposed to integrate the topological embeddings of drug-disease pairs from different heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, to distinguish the contributions of different topological scales, we designed a scale-level attention mechanism. Next, a module based on a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) was established that learns the topological representation of drug-disease pairs from the integrated vector. For the second branch, a convolutional neural network module was proposed to learn the attribute representation of drug-disease pairs by integrating similarity information and the known therapeutic relationships between drug and disease nodes. Finally, the topological representation containing multi-scale information and the attribute representation containing information about the similarities and associations were integrated through multilayer perceptron. The output score is regarded as the predicted probability of whether the drug and disease are related.

similarities, were obtained from previous studies. The dataset included 763 drugs and 681 diseases along with 3051 known associations between these drugs and diseases. The drug attribute information was acquired from DrugBank [31]; 623 drug-related chemical substructures and 1,426 protein domain items originated from the PubChem [32] and InterPro [33] database, and 4447 gene function annotations were obtained from the UniProt [34] database.
2.2 Construction of multiple drug-disease heterogeneous networks
We constructed three drug-disease heterogeneous networks using the three selected attributes, each of which uses a certain drug similarity, a disease similarity, and known treatment relationships to connect its nodes.
Drug-drug similarity networks
Multiple drug networks describe the similarity between drugs from multiple perspectives. The similarity between the drugs ri and rj increases with the number of common chemical substructures among the drugs. Additionally, the similarity among drugs increases when more common domains of target proteins or more gene ontology annotation items are present. For different attribute information, three different similarities were separately obtained using cosine similarity. These similarities describe the relevance of drugs from different drug attribute levels. When constructing the drug–drug network, the corresponding connecting edges are added between drug nodes with similarity greater than 0, and the weight of the edge is set to its similarity value. Based on the similarity values of the three different drug attributes, three drug networks were constructed. The matrix Rp = [Rp
i,j] ∈ RNr×Nr is used to represent the drug similarity network under the attribute p ∈ P, where P = {PubChem, TarProDom, GeneOntoInfoTerm}, PubChem represents the public chemical substructure, TarProDom represents the target protein domain, and GeneOntoInfoTerm represents the gene ontology term. Nr represents the number of drugs, RNr×Nr represents the real number space of Nr × Nr. The similarity Rp
i,j of ri and rj was obtained using the following formula:
Rp
i,j = Cosine(ri, rj ), p ∈ P (1)
Cosine(·) represents the cosine similarity, and the similarity values are in the interval [0, 1], ri and rj represent the one-hot vectors under attribute p.
Disease-disease network
Measuring the similarities between diseases is essential for constructing disease networks. Semantic similarity measures the relationship between diseases. Wang’s method [35], which considers the topological information of two diseases in the ontology, was used to find the semantic similarity of diseases in our work. When constructing a disease network, two diseases with a similarity greater than zero are connected by an edge. Its matrix is expressed as D = [Di,j] ∈ RNd×Nd , Nd is the number of diseases, RNd×Nd represents the real number space of Nd × Nd, Di,j is the similarity between the drug di and the drug dj, and the value of disease similarity is in the interval [0, 1].
Multiple drug-disease heterogeneous networks
According to the known drug-disease-treatment relationship, a bipartite graph connecting the drug and disease nodes was constructed. The edges in the constructed bipartite graph were used to connect Nr drugs and Nd diseases from different networks. The set of edges is represented as T = [Ti,j] ∈ RNr×Nd , u and v are drug and disease nodes, respectively, and Tu,v is used to represent the weight between them. When ri has a known therapeutic relationship with the dj, Ti,j = 1, when it is unknown, Ti,j = 0. The drug network Rp and the disease network D are connected through T , and they form a drug-disease heterogeneous network Hp = [Hp

weights are equal to the disease similarity Ddu,dv . When u and v are drug and disease nodes, respectively, the known drug-disease association Tu,v is used to represent the weight between them. The heterogeneous network Hp with different drug properties can be regarded as different views, which together constitute the multi-attribute view of the heterogeneous network {Hp|p ∈ P}, where P = {PubChem, TarProDom, GeneOntoInfoTerm} is a collection of drug properties.
2.3 Learning pairwise neighboring topological representation
The model of the left branch consists of three parts: a feature-level attention mechanism, a scale-level attention mechanism, and an encoding module based on bidirectional LSTM modules. Different drug attributes have different effects on the prediction of drug-disease association. The attention mechanism at the feature level integrates the drug-disease pair embedding vectors under different attribute views. The scale-level attention mechanism evaluates the importance of each scale view and assigns a score. The bidirectional LSTM module deeply integrates the contextual information between multiscale topologies and learns the topological representation of ri-dj pairs.
2.3.1 Multi-scale topology embedding by random walk with restart
In the drug-disease heterogeneous network Hp, if two nodes are connected by only one edge, we refer to this adjacency relationship as the adjacency of scale 1. If two nodes are connected by two (or more) end-to-end edges, we refer to this adjacency relationship as the adjacency of scale 2 (or multi-scale adjacency). In the network Hp, there are three adjacencies with a scale of 1 that have different meanings. d1-d2, r1-r2 represent the similarity between diseases and the similarity relationship between drugs, respectively, r1-d1 represents the known drug-disease relationship. The adjacency of scale 2 or more in the network can reflect more connections between drugs and diseases. For example, r1-r2-d1 means “r1 and r2 have similar chemical composition or function, and r2 and d1 have a known association, therefore r1 may also be associated with d1”. To identify and mine the potential association information contained in the adjacency topologies of different scales, we used the random walk with restart (RWR) to construct the topological structure embedding vector of the drugdisease pair. For random walks in a heterogeneous network of drug diseases, the

(3)
where each Ap
u,v represents the probability of the walker going from node u to v under the attribute p. When the walker starts from node u, after passing the s edges (i.e., crossing the s scale), the probability vectors of reaching the other nodes are [rp(s); dp(s)]. rp(s) and dp(s) are the drug and disease parts of the probability vector, respectively, and sum(rp(s)) + sum(dp(s)) = 1. At this time, the sth scale embedding vector x(s,p)
u of the node u can be composed of rp(s) and dp(s).

node, only the i element in rp(0) is set to 1, and the other elements are set to 0. Similarly, if u is a disease node, only the value of the j element in dp(0) is 1, and the rest are 0. Based on the transition matrix Ap and the initial state x0
u, The probability that the walker that starts from u will reach each node at the (s + 1)th scale is defined as follows:

ri,dj = a-stack
p∈P x(s,p)
ri,dj (7)
a-stack is stacked up and down, and x(s,·)
ri,dj ∈ RNp×(Nr+Nd). Next the different groups are stacked up and down according to the scale:
x(·,·)
ri,dj = s-stack
s=1...S x(s,·)
ri,dj (8)
where the symbol s-stack means stacking up and down according to the scale,
and x(·,·)
ri,dj ∈ RNs×Np×(Nr+Nd) is used as the input of the left branch module.
2.3.2 Attention at feature level to integrate topology embeddings
Under different networks, the edges of the same disease pair present different similarities from a unique perspective. Therefore, an attention mechanism at the feature level was constructed. The attention score of pth attribute vector x(·,p)
ri ,dj
is ep,
ep = W P tanh(Wpx(·,p)
ri,dj + bp) (9)
Wp is the parameter matrix and bp is the bias vector. W P is a parameter matrix used to capture the interrelationships between different views. Softmax was used to normalize the attention score ep to the attention weight, αp.
αp,i = exp(ep,i)
PNp
p=1 exp(ep,i)

The representation vector under the scale s is the element-wise sum of the weights of Np attribute vectors ys
ri,dj ∈ R1×(Nr+Nd) and is calculated as follows

2.3.3 Attention at scale level
Connections of different scales have different contributions to the prediction of drug-disease associations. Therefore, at the scale level, we established an attention mechanism. The attention score es and weight αs of the scale view s are calculated as follows,
es = hS tanh(W sys
ri,dj + bs) (12)
αs = exp(es)
PNs
s=1 exp(es) (13)
W s and bs are the attention weight and bias vector, respectively, and hS is a parameter vector shared by topologies of various scales. The vector enhanced by the attention mechanism is zs

2.3.4 Learning contextual relationship of multi-scale topologies by Bi-LSTM z1

ri,dj together form a topological vector sequence of ridj. To better capture the contextual relationship between multi-scale sequences, a network module based on bidirectional LSTM was built to learn the topological
representation of drug-disease pairs. The forward −−−→
LSTM and the reversed ←−−−
LSTM modules read each scale topology in the order of 1, 2, 3, . . . , Ns and Ns, Ns − 1, . . . , 1 individually. The hidden layer outputs of the forward and the backward
modules are h−→s and h−→s at the scale s.

h−→s and h←−s are spliced to get the output of bidirectional LSTM,

Concatenate(·) denotes the concatenation. The BiLSTM output sequences at different scales are stitched together to obtain the final feature output otopo ∈
R(Ns ×Nhid )×1 :
otopo = h1∥h2∥ · · · ∥hNs (18)
where ∥ represents head-to-tail splicing, and Nhid is the hidden layer of the bidirectional LSTM.
2.4 Learning pairwise multiple attribute representations
2.4.1 Construction of attribute embedding matrix
When predicting the association between ri and disease dj, we hypothesized that if ri and dj are related (or similar) to more public drugs (or diseases), they are more to be related. Therefore, as the picture shows, for the three drug-disease

heterogeneous networks, three embedding matrices are established to capture the nodes that both ri and dj are connected in each network. We used the vector xl
r in the lth matrix to represent the connection between ri and other drugs and disease nodes, and we obtain the disease vector xl
d. xl

and xl
d are spliced, and the embedding matrix Xl of ri-dj pair on the lth network was obtained. The embedding matrices of each l are used as a different channel, which together constitute the input Xattr
ri,dj ∈ R3×2×(Nr+Nd) of the right branch module.
2.4.2 Attribute representation learning based on multi-layer CNN The multi-channel embedding matrix Xattr
ri,dj of ri and dj was fed into the right CNN module to learn its attribute representation. This convolution module contained two convolution pooling layers. First, to prevent loss of information when processing boundaries, a circle of zeros was added around the input feature matrix Xattr
ri,dj and they were recorded together as Xeattr
ri,dj . We considered the first convolutional layer and the first pooling layer as examples to introduce our right convolution module. For the first convolutional layer, the number of input

channels is nin (that is, the number of attribute views Np ); we set up nc1 filters with a receptive field of wc × hc, and let them slide on the feature matrix in steps of sc1 . Each filter learns a connection mode at ri-dj pair and obtains a feature map Yc1 ∈ Rnc1 ×(4−wc+1)×(2+Nr+Nd−hc+1). X(a, b) is the receptive field when the kth filter slides to the position of the ath row and the bth column of the element. The receptive fields X(a, b) ∈ Rnin×wc×hc and the element Yc1 (k, a, b) at ath row, bth column and kth feature map are defined as follows:
X(a, b) = Xe attr

Wk
c1 and bk
c1 represent the learnable parameters at the kth filter, respectively. f (·) represents the ReLU activation function, and ∗ is sum of the product of position elements in two matrices. Maximum pooling was used to extract representative features from the multichannel feature map, Yc1 . Similarly, Yc1 was added to a circle of zero to obtain Yec1 . wp1 and hp1 as the length and height of the pooling window, respectively. The output after the pooling layer is Yp1 :
Yk
p1 (a, b) = max(Yec1 [k, a : a + wp1 , b : b + hp1 ]) (21)
1 ≤ a ≤ 4 − wc1 + 1, 1 ≤ b ≤ 2 + Nr + Nd − hc1 + 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ nc1
where Y k
p1 (a, b) represents the element in the ath row and the bth column of the feature map of the kth channel in Yp1 .
After the feature matrix X was pooled using two convolutions, the feature map Y is obtained. Y is tiled into ri-dj’s attribute representation vector oattr ∈
Rw′ h′ nout ×1 :
oattr = f latten(Y ), Y ∈ Rnout×w′×h′
w′ = ⌈ 4

⌉, h′ = ⌈ Nr + Nd + 2
hc1 hc2
⌉
⌈·⌉ represents rounding up, w′ and h′ represent the width and height of the feature map, respectively, and f latten(·) means to expand into a vector.
2.5 Loss of association prediction
To completely utilize the representation vectors otopo and oattr, a combined strategy for training and final prediction was designed. otopo and oattr are indepth representations obtained from the perspective of node pair attributes and network topology, and we concatenate them as the final representation vector of ri-dj to predict the probability of their association.
o = [otopo; oattr] (22)
A multilayer perceptron activated with sigmoid accepts o and outputs its associated predicted probability p:
p = sigmoid(W o + b) (23)
The loss1 between the predicted probability p and true probability g is defined as follows:
loss1 = −
X
p
g log(p) + (1 − g) log(1 − p) (24)
When there is a known association between ri and dj, g is 1; otherwise, g is 0. To ensure the reliability of the learned topology representation oattr and attribute representation otopo and their ability to predict independently, both representations have their own classifier. The loss of the probability distribution is calculated as follows:
ptopo = sigmoid(W topootopo + btopo) (25)
loss2 = −
X
ptopo
g log(ptopo) + (1 − g) log(1 − ptopo) (26)
pattr = sigmoid(W attroattr + battr) (27)
loss3 = −
X
pattr
g log(pattr) + (1 − g) log(1 − pattr) (28)
ptopo and pattr are the associated prediction probability distributions obtained from topological information and attribute information, respectively, The introduction of supervision information in loss2 and loss3 improves the attribute representation and topological representation capabilities in the model and makes the correlation prediction of (ri, dj) more comprehensive. The final loss L of the proposed model is defined as follows:
L = λ1loss1 + λ2loss2 + λ3loss3 (29)
λ1, λ2, λ3 are hyperparameters used to weigh the proportion of each loss item in training.
3 Experimental Evaluations and Discussions
3.1 Evaluation metrics
Five-fold cross-validation was used to systematically evaluate MTRD’s performance. All known drug-disease associations were treated as positive samples and randomly divided into five equal parts. Four of them were used for training, and the remaining one was set as unknown for testing. All drug-disease associations that have not been observed were considered negative cases. We randomly selected negative samples with an equal number of positive samples for training, and the remaining negative samples were used for testing. Evaluation metrics included the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR). The samples whose predicted score is

greater than a threshold θ are considered positive examples; otherwise, they are considered negative examples. True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) under θ are defined as follows:
TPR = TP
TP +FN,FPR = FP
T N + F P (30)
where TP (TN) is the number of samples correctly identified as positive samples (negative samples), and FP (FN) is the number of false positive samples (negative samples). The ROC curve shows the performance of the model at all classification thresholds, and the AUC is considered an evaluation criterion because of its statistical consistency[36]. The number of negative samples is far greater than that of positive samples, and there is an obvious category imbalance. When evaluating the prediction results of category imbalance, the precision-recall curve is more informative than the ROC [37]. Therefore, we also used AUPR for evaluation. Precision and Recall are defined as follows:
P recision = T P
T P + F P , Recall = T P
T P + F N (31)
Precision represents the proportion of positive identifications that was actually correct. Recall and TPR are equivalent. We first calculated the TP, FP, FN, and TN in each fold experiment, and used the mean of the five-fold crossover to obtain the final score. Biologists are more willing to choose the top-ranked drug-disease association prediction results for further experimental verification. Therefore, we also calculated the average recall value on the top k prediction results in the five-fold crossover as another performance indicator standard of the model. The higher the recall value, the higher is the score given by the model contains more real associations, and the more reliable is the prediction result.
3.2 Comparison with other methods
MTRD was compared with six state-of-the-art methods for drug-disease association prediction, including GFPred [30], CBPred[38], SCMFDD[26], LRSSL [25], MBiRW[22], and HGBI[39]. In MSTD, the random walk step size S is set to 3, the restart probability is α=0.3, and both the forward and reverse hidden layer output dimensions of the BiLSTM module are 80. The number of hidden layer neurons in the attention mechanism is half of the number of input neurons, kernal size=2 × 2, padding=1 in each layer of CNN, the convolution operation stride=1, the channels are 16, 32, and the pooling operation stride=2. λ1, λ2, λ3 = [0.6, 0.2, 0.2], lr = 0.001 and the early stopping strategy (the loss value on the training set does not fluctuate more than 5% for 10 consecutive rounds) was used to train 150 epochs. For a fair comparison, MTRD and the other six methods use the same data set. Furthermore, the other six methods use their own optimal parameter settings for reporting: drug attri-encoder with four neuron layers (4000,2000,1000,700), disease attri-encoder with two neuron layers (1000,700), combination module with two convolutional layers (kernels 2 × 4 and 3 × 3, poolings 2 × 2 and 1 × 3, and channels 16 and 32) for GFPred; lr = 0.001 and λ = 0.12 for CBPred; k=45%,λ = 4 and u = 1 for SCMFDD; u = λ = 0.01, k = 10 and γ = 2 for LRSSL; d = log(9999), c = -11,α = 0.3 and r = l =2 for MBiRW; and α= 0.4 for HGBI. In each fold, we obtained the prediction score for each drug-disease pair and calculated the average of five crossover experiments as the final prediction score. The ROC curves and P-R curves of all the drugs evaluated using the seven methods are shown in Figure 5. On comparing all methods for 763 diseases, we observefd that MTRD reached the highest 0.973 with an average AUC, which was 2.8% higher than GFPred, 4.7% higher than CBPred, 25% higher than SCMFDD, 14.2% higher than LRSSL, 14.5% higher than MBiRW, and 27.1% higher than HGBI. HGBI and SCMFDD only consider some similarity information between nodes, and have the lowest performance among the seven methods. The performance of MBiRW using the comprehensive similarity metric was improved by 12.6% compared to that of HGBI and 10.5% higher than that of SCMFDD. LRSSL integrates multiple attribute information of drugs and diseases based on sparse subspace learning, which is better than the above-mentioned similarity-based learning. The method performance has been further improved (0.3% for MBiRW,12.9% for HGBI, and 10.8% for SCMFDD). Two deep

learning-based methods, GFPred and CBPred, not only integrate the multi-source attribute information but also consider the neighbor node attributes of the drug node and the route between the drug disease nodes; this significantly improved the prediction performance ( 0.945 and 0.926, respectively). However, for AUPR, CBPred’s performance was 1.9% lower than that of LRSSL’s 0.107. One possible reason is that the known drug-disease nodes have very few associations and the network is sparse, which makes it difficult for the model to find enough paths to learn the expression of the drug-disease pairs. Compared with all the above methods, MTRD formally takes the multi-scale topology and attribute information of the network as the main learning objectives of the model; on the one hand, it integrates the attributes of neighbor nodes, and on the other hand, it avoids the loss of prediction accuracy caused by the lack of path information. MTRD also achieved the highest score of 0.355 on AUPR, which was 11%, 26.7%, 33.2%, 24.8%, 31%, and 34.3% higher than GFPred, CBPred, SCMFDD, LRSSL, MBiRW, and HGBI, respectively.

We used the Wilcoxon test to verify whether MTRD was better. We obtained the average AUC and AUPR of seven groups implementing the seven methods in the five-fold crossover experiment, and each group contained the AUC and AUPR scores of 763 drugs. We calculated the results of six pairs of Wilcoxon tests between our method and other methods. The statistical results shown in the table 1 revealed that our method is significantly better than the other six methods (p-value< 0.05).

The candidate association recall rate of the top k is shown in 6. The higher the recall rate, the more accurate is identification of drug-disease associations by the model. The average recall rates of MTRD for 763 drugs were 85.50% in the top 30, 89.13% in the top 60, and 91.10% in the top 90, which is significantly higher than those of the other six methods. MTRD was higher than GFPred by 11.21%, 8.34%, and 5.90% for the top 30, top 60, and top 90, respectively, and 16.70%, 12.21%, and 9.63% higher than CBPred. The recall of MTRD, GFPred, and

CBPred in the top k are significantly higher than those of the other four methods. The recall rates of LRSSL and MBiRW were very similar. When the values of k are 30, 60, and 90, the former are 62.12%, 70.61%, and 74.88%, which is slightly higher than the latter’s 53.06%, 66.30%, and 74.71%, respectively. When the value of k is 150, 180, and 210, MBiRW performs slightly better than LRSSL. The recall rates of SCMFDD were 27.97%, 50.68%, 59.47%, and 65.97% in the top 30, 90, 150, and 210, respectively, and those of HGBI were 25.70%, 45.61%, 55.58%, and 63.47%, respectively, which were the worst among the seven methods.
3.3 Case studies on five drugs
We conducted case studies on five drugs: ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and hydrocortisone. This study further proved the ability of MTRD to predict drug-disease associations. We used descending order to sort the candidate disease associations of each drug, and collected and analyzed the top 10 disease candidate results in the table 2. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a literature-based toxicological information database that is reviewed and manually sorted by professional biocurators. It encodes and correlates important information about human diseases, such as drugs, genes, and phenotypes [40]. The DrugBank database contains detailed information about FDA-approved drugs and experimental drugs that have passed the FDA approval process [31]. In the table 2, there are 38 and 29 drug-disease associations included in CTD and DrugBank, respectively, indicating that these drugs can indeed be used to treat the predicted diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) is the world’s largest online clinical trial registry, which includes various trials funded by state grants or private funds around the world. In the case analysis, we used the experimental records included in the case, and the status was marked as "completed" as the supporting material for the candidate disease. PubChem[32] is currently the largest collection of chemical information supported by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which also includes associated disorders and diseases of small-molecule drugs. Forty candidate associations were found in clinical trials, and 25 were found in PubChem. They indicated that these drug-disease associations have been verified in clinical trials. In addition to manually curated associations, CTD also includes drug and disease associations inferred from the literature. In the case study, the relationship between Pseudomonas infections and ampicillin was inferred from five studies in the CTD. This indicates that Pseudomonas infections are very likely to be treated with ampicillin. Among all 50 candidate drug-disease associations, there is one association that has not been confirmed by observational evidence and is
marked as "unconfirmed." In conclusion, the case analysis further demonstrates the ability of MTRD to determine potential drug-disease associations.
3.4 Prediction of novel drug-disease associations
Finally, we used all known drug-disease associations to train the model and predict disease candidates for the drug of interest. The top 15 disease candidates predicted by MTRD are listed in Supplementary Table ST1. It can be used to help biologists discover new drug-disease associations through further wet-lab experiments.
4 Conclusion
We proposed a method to encode and fuse the similarity and association connections with various scales within multiple bi-layer networks for prediction of candidate drug-related diseases. The constructed multiple drug-disease networks are benefit for formulating their specific neighboring topology embeddings based on random walks. The multi-scale pairwise neighboring topology embeddings are formed by adjusting the ranges that the random walker may walk in the networks. A Bi-LSTM based module is constructed to capture the context relationships among multi-scale topology embeddings, and to learn the pairwise topology representation. A multi-layer convolutional networks based module is also constructed to encode and integrate the various pairwise attributes from multiple heterogenous networks. Two attention mechanisms are established to assign greater weights for the more informative features and topology embeddings. The cross-validation results indicated that MTRD outperforms than other six advanced methods in terms of both AUC and AUPR. The higher recall rates in the top ranked candidates and the case studies demonstrated MTRD’s ability in discovering the potential drug-disease associations.

Key Points
• Three bi-layer heterogeneous networks are established, and each of them is composed of the drug and disease nodes, and their related similarity connections and association connections. Each bi-layer network has its specific topology information, which is benefit for its subsequent topology representation learning. • Multiple kinds of drug similarities reflect topologies among the drug nodes from different perspectives. At the same time, each drug node (or disease node) has neighboring topologies with multiple scales. Therefore, we design the strategy based on random walks in the networks to construct various topology embeddings. • A new framework based on Bi-LSTM and convolutional networks is constructed to learn the neighboring topology representation and attribute representation of a pair of drug and disease nodes. The topology representation reveals the multi-scale topology structures of multiple bi-layer networks, while the attribute representation encodes the similarity and association attributes of the node pair. • Due to the various contributions of different features and different topological scales to drug-disease association prediction, we establish the feature-level and scale-level attention mechanisms to discriminate their contributions.
