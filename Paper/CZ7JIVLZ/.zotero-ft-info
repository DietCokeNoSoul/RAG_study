Title:          Dual Convolutional Neural Networks With Attention Mechanisms Based Method for Predicting Disease-Related lncRNA Genes
Subject:        A lot of studies indicated that aberrant expression of long non-coding RNA genes (lncRNAs) is closely related to human diseases.
Keywords:       lncRNA-disease prediction, dual convolutional neural networks, attention at feature level, attention at relationship level, lncRNA-miRNA interactions
