Abstract
As an increasing number of miRNAs have become the biomarkers of various human
diseases, prediction of the candidate disease-related miRNAs is helpful for facilitating
the early diagnosis of diseases. Most of the recent prediction models concentrated on
learning of the features from the heterogeneous graph composed of the miRNAs and
diseases. However, they failed to fully exploit the subgraph structures consisting of
multiple miRNA and disease nodes, and they also did not completely integrate the
context relationships among the pairwise features. We proposed a prediction model,
1


SFPred, to integrate and encode the local topologies from neighborhood subgraphs, the
dynamically evolved heterogeneous graph topology, and the context among pairwise
features. First, the importance of a miRNA (disease) node to another node is formu
lated according to their subgraphs composed of their neighbors. Second, the features
of each miRNA (disease) node continuously change when the graph encoding gradu
ally deepens for the miRNA-disease heterogeneous network. A strategy based on MLP
is designed to estimate the edge weights according to the changed node features and
form the dynamic graph topology. Third, considering the context relationships among
the features of a pair of miRNA and disease nodes, a context relationship sensitive
transformer is constructed to integrate these relationships. Finally, since the previous
encoding layer of the transformer contains more detailed features of the pairwise, we
present a multi-perspective residual strategy to supplement the detailed features to the
following encoding layer from the channel perspective and the feature one, respectively.
The extensive experiments confirmed that SFPred outperforms eight state-of-the-art
methods for prediction of miRNA-disease associations, and the ablation experiments
validate the effectiveness of the proposed innovations. The recall rates for the top
ranked candidate miRNAs related to the diseases and the case studies on three dis
eases indicate SFPred’s ability in screening the reliable candidates for the subsequent
biological experiments.
Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs, typically 22 to 24 nucleotides long,
that can regulate the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs)1–3 . An increasing number of
studies indicate a significant correlation between miRNAs and the onset and progression of
many diseases. For example, the expression of miR-509 is markedly decreased in colorectal
cancer tissues and cells compared to normal tissues.4 Additionally, miR-451a and miR-139
show promise as biomarkers for diagnosing lung squamous cell carcinoma.5 Therefore, uncov
ering potential miRNA-disease associations is crucial for understanding disease pathogenesis
and advancing diagnosis and treatment.
Computerized methods for predicting disease-related miRNAs can offer biologists more
dependable candidates for screening true associations between miRNAs and diseases. These
2


methods can be broadly categorized into three groups. The first category relies on the
biological premise that miRNAs with similar functions are typically associated with similar
diseases.6 The functional similarity between two miRNAs is determined by their associated
diseases,7 and a miRNA graph is constructed using this information. HDMP8 predicts the
association between miRNAs and diseases by aggregating information from the k -nearest
neighbors within the miRNA graph. Additionally, the random walk with restart method has
been employed to infer miRNA-disease associations.9 However, these methods are challenging
to apply to diseases that lack known associated miRNAs. Another approach involves a model
based on the hypergeometric distribution of multiple miRNA similarities.10 However, this
model does not take into account disease similarity.
The second type of methods integrate disease similarity and miRNA-disease association
information into the miRNA functional graph, resulting in a miRNA-disease heterogeneous
graph. KATZ11 algorithm is used to capture neighbor information within this graph, along
with network consistency projection to determine the probability of miRNA-disease asso
ciations. Various approaches, such as matrix completion,12–15 random walks,16–19 random
forests,20,21 regression trees,22 and probabilistic matrix factorization,23,24 are utilized to pre
dict new miRNA candidates for diseases. However, these methods are considered shallow
prediction models and do not extensively learn the feature representation of miRNA and
disease nodes.
Deep learning is able to learn the deep representative features of objects, and achieve
decent performance in image reconstruction for magnetic particle imaging25 and disease
related miRNA prediction. Some approaches utilize neural networks to learn the features of
miRNAs and diseases and predict candidate miRNAs through neural-induced matrix com
pletion models.26,27 For example, the GCNA-MDA28 prediction model learns the feature
representations of miRNA and disease nodes using fully-connected neural networks and au
toencoders. However, these models typically focus on individual miRNA similarity graphs
and disease similarity graphs. For the miRNA-disease heterogeneous network, several predic
tion methods have been proposed, which are based on contrastive learning,29–32 generative
adversarial strategies,33,34 graph convolution networks,35 stacked autoencoders,36 and graph
3


attention networks.37–40 Nevertheless, these methods do not fully take into account the dy
namic changes in graph topology during multi-layer graph inference processes.
In this paper, we designed a method based on subgraph and dynamic topologies en
hanced graph convolutional network and f eature context relationship sensitive transformer
for prediction of miRNA-disease associations (SFPred). It intelligently combines local topo
logical information from subgraphs within a heterogeneous graph, continuously evolving
graph topology structures, and takes into account the relationships between features of pair
wise. The advantages of our approach are summarized as follows.
First, the subgraphs composed of the neighborhood nodes were constructed for each
miRNA (disease) node to exploit the local graph structures within the miRNA-disease het
erogeneous graph. Most of the previous prediction methods focused on aggregating the
features of the neighbor nodes and they did not fully integrate the subgraph structures con
sisting these neighbors. We designed a novel strategy to estimate the importance between
two nodes by integrating the overlapped vertices and edges in their subgraphs.
Second, the graph learning process includes multiple graph convolution layers, and the
features of miRNA and disease nodes are evolved dynamically with the increasement of layers.
We presented a strategy based on MLP to update the weights of the connections among all
the miRNAs and disease nodes and form the dynamic heterogeneous graph topology.
Third, the features of a pair of miRNA and disease nodes contain the similarities and
associations between one of these nodes and all the miRNA and disease nodes, thus these
features have context relationships. A learning strategy based on both convolution neural
network and context sensitive transformer was presented to integrate the context relation
ships.
Finally, the original dual-channel features of the pairwise imply more pairwise details.
The residual strategies from both channel and feature perspectives are designed to fuse the
representative features from the deep encoding layer of the transformer and the detailed
features from the shallow encoding layer. The contributions of SFPred’s major innovations
for the improved prediction performance, and SFPred’s superior prediction performance were
showed by the ablation experiments, the comparison with the advanced prediction methods,

Materials and methods
We propose a model called SFPred (Figure 1) to predict potential miRNAs associated with
a given disease. Within the miRNA-disease heterogeneous graph, we construct subgraphs
of the first-order neighborhood for any pair of nodes. This allows us to create a locally
topological enhanced heterogeneous graph adjacency matrix. As the node features continu
ously change during the multi-layer graph inferring process, the topology between nodes also
dynamically evolves. To address this, we incorporate a mechanism for dynamic topological
embedding to capture and adapt to topology changes throughout the graph reasoning pro
cess. Furthermore, we employ a feature learning module based on transformer to capture
contextual relationships between the features of pairwise miRNA-disease.
Dataset
We gathered a dataset consisting of 7,908 confirmed associations between miRNAs and dis
eases from the Human MicroRNA Disease Database.41 This dataset includes 793 miRNAs
5


and 341 diseases. A directed acyclic graph (DAGs) for a disease typically embraces all terms
related to that disease, sourced from the American Library of Medicine.42 To measure seman
tic similarity between diseases, we followed previous studies7 and calculated the similarity
based on the DAGs of the two diseases.
Construction of the miRNA-disease heterogeneous graph
We constructed a heterogeneous graph G = (V, E) incorporating nodes representing miRNAs
and diseases, along with their association and similarity connections. The node set V =
Vmicro∪Vdisea consists of the miRNA node set Vmicro and the disease node set Vdisea. The
edge set E includes edges representing miRNA-disease associations, miRNA similarities, and
disease similarities. An edge ei,j∈E is used to connect pairs of nodes vi,vj∈V. The miRNA
disease association matrix Kmicro−disea is formulated as,
Kmicro−disea∈RNm×Nd , if vi∈V micro, vj ∈V disea (1)
where Nm and Nd signify the quantities of miRNAs and diseases, respectively. In the matrix
Kmicro−disea, the i -th row Kmicro−disea
i,∗ is the associations between the i -th miRNA vi∈Vmicro
and all diseases. The miRNAs associated with the disease are recorded in the j -th column
Kmicro−disea
∗,j of matrix Kmicro−disea. If vi∈Vmicro, vj∈Vdisea already have a known association,
Kmicro−disea
ij is 1; otherwise, Kmicro−disea
ij is 0.
The similarity matrix O incorporates the miRNA similarity matrix Omicro and the disease
similarity matrix Odisea,
O=

  
  
Omicro∈RNm×Nm
Odisea∈RNd×Nd .
(2)
The degree of similarity between two miRNA (disease) nodes vi, vj is reflected by Omicro
ij (Odisea
ij ),
which has a value ranging from 0 to 1. A higher value of Omicro
ij (Odisea
ij ) symbolizes greater
functional(semantic) similarity. The semantic similarity of two diseases is calculated using
their DAGs, following the method proposed by Wang et al .7 Omicro
ij represents the similar
ity between miRNA nodes vi and vj, which is computed based on the two sets of diseases
6


associated with vi, vj.

where Kmicro−diseaT represents the transpose of Kmicro−disea, and NV = Nm + Nd. The i -th
row of A, denoted as Ai, contains the associations and similarities between node vi and all
miRNAs and diseases, serving as the attribute vector for vi. Therefore, A can be considered
as the node feature matrix of the miRNA-disease heterogeneous graph and is denoted as X.
Subgraph and dynamic topologies enhancement for node feature
learning
The first-order neighbors of each miRNA (disease) node vi and the edges among them form
the first-order neighbor subgraph. Most of previous methods did not fully leverage the local
topology within a subgraph. During the process of graph convolutional learning, the node
features change gradually, resulting in a dynamical changing graph topology. We proposed
the subgraph and dynamic topology enhanced graph convolutional network (SDGCN) to
integrate the topological representations of miRNA and disease nodes. SDGCN comprises Lte

graph convolutional layers, with each block containing importance evaluation block between
nodes and a dynamic topological embedding block. We describe the learning process of the
l-th graph convolutional layer to illustrate.
In the l-th layer, the first-order neighbor set of miRNA (disease) nodes vi is represented as
φ(i) = {vj∈V|(vi, vj)∈E}, where E is the set of edges of graph G. Furthermore, the neighbor
nodes in φ(i) include both miRNA and disease node types. The first-order neighborhood
subgraph of vi, denoted as Si, covers the similarity and association connections between
vj∈φ(i) ∪ vi, reflecting their respective local topology. For miRNA (disease) nodes vi and
vj, Sij = Si ∪ Sj represents their overlapped subgraph (Figure 2).
To obtain the importance of miRNA (disease) node vi to vj at the local topological level,
we calculate its local topological coefficient cij based on Sij,
cij = |qij|
|pij| · |pij − 1| × |pij|σ (4)
where pij and qij represent the number of vertices and edges of Sij, respectively, and σ is a
hyperparameter. By calculating cij between any two miRNA (disease) nodes, we obtain the
local topological cofficient matrix C. We normalize C using the Laplacian to obtain C ̃,
C ̃ = (D)− 1
2 (C + I)(D)− 1

where Dii = P
jCij, and I represents the identity matrix.
SDGCN consists of multiple graph convolutional layers. As the number of encoding
layers increases, the features of miRNA and disease nodes evolve gradually, leading to a
dynamic change of the heterogeneous graph topology. Most previous methods did not fully
integrate the dynamic topologies during the graph convolution process. We designed a
dynamic topology encoding strategy to capture the topological changes of heterogeneous
graph (Figure 3). The miRNA (disease) nodes vi and vj, their node features at the (l-1)-th
layer are articulated as xl−1
i and xl−1
j respectively. The connection between xl−1
i and xl−1
j
forms the edge weight tl

where W l
t and bl
t represent the weight matrix and bias vector of the l-th layer, respectively,
and [; ] denotes the concatenation operation. The connection weights between all pairs of
miRNA (disease) nodes are computed to obtain the dynamic adjacency matrix T l.
C ̃ and T l represent the adjacency matrices for node importance and dynamic topology,
respectively. C ̃ and T l contribute differently to the topological representation learning of
nodes, we designed an adaptive fusion strategy. α and β are the learnable parameters to
balance the contribution of two matrices, resulting in the fused adjacency matrix H,
H = αC ̃⊕βT l (7)

Feature context learning based on transformer
A miRNA has the neighboring miRNAs which have similar functions with it and it also
has the neighboring diseases which are associated with it. Similarly, a disease also has its
neighboring diseases and miRNAs. Thus, the features of a miRNA (disease) include these
similarities and associations. As the miRNA with similar functions are usually associated
with similar diseases, the pairwise features have contextual relationships. The previous
methods did not fully utilize these contextual relationships. We designed a feature context
sensitive transformer (FCTransformer) to capture these relationships. FCTransformer con
sists of Lfcl encoding layers. We illustrate the encoding process using the l-th layer as an
example.
We stack the feature vectors xi and xNm+j of mi and dj along the channel dimension to
obtain the original pairwise feature embedding for mi-dj F ∈ R(NV,2) (as shown in Figure
1c). The k-th column contains a pair of features, and it is worth to be focused on. Assuming
k is 5, if m5 has similar function to mi and m5 is associated with dj, mi is more likely to be
associated with dj. The l-th layer’s input feature map F l−1 ∈ R(Nl−1,Cl−1) has Cl−1 channels.
In the i-th attention head, we conduct Cl−1
M 1×1 convolutions on F l−1, and then we get

l ∈ R(Nl−1, Cl
M ), Ki
l ∈ R(Nl−1, Cl

where Nl−1 represents the dimension of the pairwise feature in the (l-1)-th layer, and Cl

denotes the number of channels per head. P Q
l,i, P K
l,i , P V
l,i represent the sets containing Cl−1
M
1×1 convolution kernels, respectively. F 0 = F , ’∗’ represents the convolution operation. The
dot product operation of Qi
l and Ki
l yields the attention score matrix Qi
l (K i
l )T at the pairwise
feature level. Qi
l (K i
l )T is then normalized and multiplied with V i
l to obtain the feature matrix

l, which captures the contextual relationships of pairwise for the i-th attention head,
Di

where d = Nl−1, which is utilized to smooth gradients during the training process. After

obtained,
Dl =
i=1

Di

where ` denotes the concatenation operation.
For the original dual-channel pairwise feature map, the encoding layers of FCTransformer
may alter its number of channels and feature dimension. The previous methods did not
completely utilize the detailed information from both the channel and feature perspectives.
Therefore, it is necessary to design a multi-perspective residual supplementation strategy to
complement the information. The pairwise feature matrix obtained from the (l-1)-th layer
learning is denoted as F l−1∈R(Nl−1,Cl−1). A fully-connected neural network is applied to
adjust the channel number of F l−1, ensuring it matches the number of channels as Dl. The
resulting feature matrix is denoted as Fˆl−1∈R(Nl−1,Cl),
Fˆl−1 = θ(W l
F F l−1 + bl
F ). (14)
Here, θ represents the GELU 43 activation function, W l
F is the weight matrix, and bl
F is the
bias vector.
The feature matrix Fˆl−1 contains more detailed features of pairwise mi-dj, and we com
11


bine it with Dl to obtain Dˆl∈R(Nl−1,Cl) using channel residual connections,
Dˆ l = Fˆl−1 ⊕ Dl, (15)
where ⊕ represents element-wise addition. Dˆl is then subjected to a fully-connected neural
network to reduce the dimensionality of the pairwise features, forming the pairwise feature
matrix D ̃ l∈R(Nl,Cl),
D ̃l = Relu(W l
dDˆ l + bl
d), (16)
where W l
d and bl
d represent the weight matrix and bias vector, respectively.
Similarly, Fˆl−1 also undergoes a fully-connected layer to make it consistent with the
feature dimension of D ̃l, resulting in a pairwise feature matrix F ̃l−1∈R(Nl,Cl),
F ̃l−1 = Relu(W l
f F l−1 + bl
f ) (17)
where W l
f denotes the weight matrix, and bl
f denotes the bias vector. Feature residual is
then applied to F ̃l−1 and D ̃l to obtain the feature matrix F l for the l-th layer,
F l = F ̃l−1⊕D ̃ l (18)
The enhanced representation of pairwise context for mi-dj, obtained after F undergoes
learning through Lfcl encoding layers, is denoted as F fcl∈R(Nfcl,Cfcl). F fcl is then reshaped
and renamed as xfcl
ij ∈R(1,Cfcl×Nfcl).

The fully-connected layer and the softmax layer are employed to calculate the association
distributions of mi and dj, represented as φ,

where Wmix and bmix represent the learnable weight matrices and bias vectors, respectively.
φ [0] represents the probability that mi and dj are not associated, while φ [1] represents the
probability that they are associated.
We calculate the cross-entropy loss between the true labels of miRNA and disease pairwise

where ylabel denotes the true labels, and ylabel = 1 if the miRNA and disease are already

and its L2 regularization is introduced to prevent overfitting, with ρ being a hyperparameter.
Experimental results and discussions
Parameter settings
The number of SDGCN encoding layers and that of FCTransformer encoding layers were
selected from {1, 2, 3}. The experiments were conducted for all the combinations of their
layer numbers. As shown in the supplementary table S1, the model achieved the highest
AUC (AUC = 0.941) and AUPR (AUPR = 0.470) when both of their layer numbers were 2.
The possible reason is that a single encoding layer failed to completely learn the deep asso
ciations between miRNAs and diseases, while three encoding layer may amplify the useless
information within the data about miRNAs and diseases. The dimenstions of the output
features from SDGCN’s first and second layers were 512 and 128, respectively. The output
feature dimensions of FCTransformer’s first and second layers were set to 256 and 64, and
the number of heads in each layer was 4. The filter size and number in FCTransformer’s first
encoding layer were set to 1×1 and 16, respectively, and its stride was 1. FCTransformer’s
13


second encoding layer contained 16 filters with size=1×1 and stride=1. The channel number
of the first layer, C1, was selected from {128, 64, 32}, and that of the second layer, C2, was
selected from {64, 32, 16}. The model achieved the best performance when C1 and C2 were
64 and 16, respectively (supplementary table S2). After the enhanced pairwise feature rep
resentations were obtained, the input and output dimensions of the fully-connected neural
network were 1024 and 256, respectively. During the process of estimation of association
scores, the dimension of hidden layer of fully-connected neural network was 64. During
training, the learning rate was set to 0.001, and weight decay was set to 0.0005.
Evaluate metrics
Five-fold cross-validation is performed to evaluate the performance of SFPred and other
comparison models. The observed associations between miRNA and diseases are considered
positive samples, while the negative samples consist of all unobserved miRNA-disease pair
wise. In each fold of cross-validation, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
The training set contains 80% of the positive samples and an equal number of randomly
chosen negative samples. On the other hand, the testing set comprises the remaining 20%
of positive samples and all remaining negative samples.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve area (AUC) and Precision-Recall (PR)
curve area (AUPR), as well as the recall of top k candidates, are used as evaluation metrics
to assess model performance. For each of the 341 diseases, we obtain the AUC and AUPR
values through five-fold cross-validation. The average AUC and AUPR values across all folds
are then considered as the predictive results for that disease. Similarly, the average results of
AUC and AUPR for all diseases are regarded as the predictive results for the entire model.
Biologists typically focus on the top-ranked predictions for further validation. Therefore, we
calculate the recall of the top k∈[30, 60, ..., 240] candidates, where k ranges from 30 to 240
with a step size of 30, to evaluate the prediction performance. A higher recall indicates that
more true associations are found among the top-ranked candidates.
Ablation experiments
Ablation experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of inter-node importance
evaluation (INIE), dynamic topology embedding (DTE), and pairwise feature context learn
14


ing (PFCL), channel residual strategy (CRS) and feature residual strategy (FRS), as pre
sented in Table 1.
Table 1: Results of conducting the ablation experiments on SFPred.
INIE DTE PFCL CRS FRS Average AUC Average AUPR
× ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ 0.937 0.431 ✓ × ✓ ✓ ✓ 0.934 0.423 ✓ ✓ × ✓ ✓ 0.908 0.296 ✓ ✓ ✓ × ✓ 0.937 0.454 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ × 0.932 0.413 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ 0.941 0.470
When the model lacked INIE, the AUC and AUPR decreased by 0.4% and 3.9%, respec
tively. Similarly, ignoring DTE resulted in a 0.7% decrease in AUC and a 4.7% decrease in
AUPR compared to the final model. In contrast, compared to the model without PFCL, the
complete model demonstrated an improvement of 3.3% in AUC and 17.4% in AUPR. After
removing CRS, the corresponding AUC and AUPR decreased by 0.4% and 1.6%, respec
tively. The model without FRS has an AUC and AUPR that are 0.9% and 5.7% lower than
the complete model, respectively. This indicated that the supplementation of detailed infor
mation from both the channel and feature perspectives is indeed able to enhance the pairwise
feature learning. Experimental results suggest that PFCL has the greatest contribution to
enhancing prediction performance. This is attributed to its focus on information directly
related to miRNA-disease pairwise and its effective integration of contextual relationships
between pairwise features.
Comparison with other methods
SFPred is compared with eight state-of-the-art miRNA-disease prediction methods, includ
ing Liu’s method,16 NIMCGCN,27 GMDA,44 MMGCN,45 NIMGSA,26 AGAEMD,37 AMH
MDA,46 and MAMFGAT.40 As depicted in Figure 4, using the optimal parameters for each
method, SFPred achieves the best performance in terms of average AUC and AUPR for all
341 diseases (AUC = 0.941, AUPR = 0.470). SFPred’s average AUC is 5% better than Liu’s
method, 8.7% higher than NIMCGCN, 1.3% and 4.7% higher than GMDA and MMGCN,
respectively. It outperforms NIMGSA and AGAEMD by 8% and 3.2%, respectively, and is
15


4.4% and 2.4% better than AMHMDA and MAMFGAT. In terms of average AUPR values,
SFPred is 37.1% higher than Liu’s methods on average, 22% higher than GMDA, 28.4%
higher than NIMCGCN, 30.8% higher than MMGCN, 30.4% higher than NIMGSA, 12.8%
higher than AGAEMD, 28.3% higher than AMHMDA, and 9.2% higher than MAMFGAT.

Figure 4: ROC curves and PR curves of SFPred and the compared methods.
We conducted Wilcoxon tests to determine whether SFPred achieved significantly higher
AUC (AUPR) values compared to other methods across all 341 diseases. The results of
the paired Wilcoxon tests (Table 2) indicate that, with a p-value threshold of 0.05, SFPred
consistently achieved significantly better predictive performance.

Liu’s method relies on shallow prediction models based on non-negative matrix factor
ization, which struggle to capture the deep features of miRNA-disease nodes, resulting in
16


slightly inferior performance. NIMCGCN, MMGCN, and AMHMDA employ graph convo
lution techniques to learn node latent representations separately from single-layer graphs
of miRNA and disease similarity, thereby overlooking known miRNA-disease association.
NIMGSA, AGAEMD and MAMFGAT primarily concentrate on graph inference learning on
heterogeneous networks. However, these methods overlook the dynamic evolution of graph
topology information during the inference process. GMDA, on the other hand, employs
generative adversarial networks to learn feature embeddings of miRNA-disease pairwise.
However, it falls short in integrating rich contextual information among pairwise features.

lower recall rates, with values of 40.2%, 59.5%, 70.5%, and 77.9%.
Case studies: Breast neoplasms, Hepatocellular carcinoma, and
Lymphoma
To demonstrate SFPred’s ability to identify promising candidate miRNAs related to diseases,
we conducted case studies on breast neoplasms, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma.
For each disease, candidate miRNAs were ranked in descending order based on their associ
ation scores, and the top 50 candidates were listed.

Firstly, we used several databases for validation. The miRTarBase database contains
miRNA-disease interactions that have been experimentally validated. These interactions
are obtained through NLP text mining of relevant literature, followed by manual curation
and verification. The miRCancer database includes associations between miRNAs and can
cer that have been experimentally validated and extracted from published literature. The
miR2Disease database focuses on the abnormal expression of miRNAs and their links to dis
eases. Table 3 presents the top 50 candidates related to breast neoplasms, with 34 candidates
recorded in miRTarBase, 32 in miRCancer, and 11 in miR2Disease. This result indicates the
18


dysregulation of these miRNAs in breast neoplasms and their documented associations with
the disease.
Moreover, the dbDEMC database collects miRNA data with differential expression levels
between cancer tissues and normal tissues from various sources such as the Gene Expression
Omnibus, ArrayExpress, Sequence Read Archive, and the Cancer Genome Atlas. Among the
top 50 candidates, 45 were confirmed in this database, indicating significant differences in
their expression levels in breast neoplasms compared to normal tissues. Additionally, three
candidate miRNAs, hsa-mir-135,47 hsa-mir-1948 and hsa-mir-513a,49 have literature support
and are marked as “Literature”. Hsa-mir-135 is downregulated in breast neoplasm tissues,
hsa-mir-19 and hsa-mir-513a are upregulated compared to normal tissues.
The top 50 candidates associated with hepatocellular carcinoma are presented in supple
mentary table S3, miRTarBase includes 5 candidates, miRCancer includes 29, and miR2Disease
includes 4, underscoring the strong evidence supporting their involvement in hepatocellular
carcinoma. These findings suggest significant differences in the expression levels of these
candidates between hepatocellular carcinoma and normal tissues. Additionally, dbDEMC
reports 48 candidates, indicating significant disparities in their expression levels between
hepatocellular carcinoma and normal tissues. Moreover, one candidate, identified as “Liter
ature” exhibits upregulation in expression levels in this disease,50 as documented in relevant
literature.
Supplementary table S4 presents the top 50 candidates associated with lymphoma. Among
these candidates, 34 are supported by miRTarBase, indicating their established association
with the disease. Moreover, the dbDEMC database includes 49 candidate genes, suggesting
the involvement of these miRNAs in lymphoma. Notably, the expression levels of hsa-mir
46651 are significantly upregulated in lymphoma patients compared to healthy individuals.
Prediction of new disease-associated miRNAs
To identify new miRNAs associated with diseases, we utilize all known miRNA-disease as
sociations, as well as an equal number of randomly selected unobserved pairwise, to train
the SFPred model. Afterward, we apply this trained model to predict potential miRNAs
linked to 341 diseases. The top 50 candidate scores for each disease prediction can be found
19


in supplementary table S5.
Conclusions
We presented a miRNA-disease association prediction method to integrate the subgraph
topologies, heterogeneous graph topology, and the context relationships among the pairwise
features. The constructed subgraphs consisting of a miRNA (disease) node and its first-order
neighbors is beneficial for formulating the importance between two nodes from their local
topology perspective. The graph topology composed of all the miRNA and disease nodes
was dynamically changed by measuring the edge weights based on MLP. The designed convo
lution transformer module was able to capture the context relationships among the pairwise
features. The channel-level and feature-level residual strategies supplement the detailed
features to the pairwise feature context learning. The 5-fold cross-validation experimental
results indicated that SFPred achieves higher AUC and AUPR than the 8 compared meth
ods. SFPred’s higher recall rates demonstrates its ability in discovering the more genuine
associations in the top-ranked candidates. Case studies on 3 diseases further show SFPred
is able to get the reliable candidate miRNAs for the diseases.
