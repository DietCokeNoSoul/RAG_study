Abstract
Motivation: Identifying and developing novel therapeutic effects for existing drugs contributes to reduction of drug development costs. Most of the previous methods focus on integration of the heterogeneous data of drugs and diseases from multiple sources for predicting the candidate drug-disease associations. However, they fail to take the prior knowledge of drugs and diseases and their sparse characteristic into account. It is essential to develop a method that exploits the more useful information to predict the reliable candidate associations. Results: We present a method based on non-negative matrix factorization, DisDrugPred, to predict the drug-related candidate disease indications. A new type of drug similarity is firstly calculated based on their associated diseases. DisDrugPred completely integrates two types of disease similarities, the associations between drugs and diseases, and the various similarities between drugs from different levels including the chemical structures of drugs, the target proteins of drugs, the diseases associated with drugs, and the side effects of drugs. The prior knowledge of drugs and diseases and the sparse characteristic of drug-disease associations provide a deep biological perspective for capturing the relationships between drugs and diseases. Simultaneously, the possibility that a drug is associated with a disease is also dependant on their projections in the low-dimension feature space. Therefore, DisDrugPred deeply integrates the diverse prior knowledge, the sparse characteristic of associations, and the projections of drugs and diseases. DisDrugPred achieves superior prediction performance than several state-of-the-art methods for drug-disease association prediction. During the validation process, DisDrugPred also can retrieve more actual drug-disease associations in the top part of prediction result which often attracts more attention from the biologists. Moreover, case studies on 5 drugs further confirm DisDrugPred’s ability to discover potential candidate disease indications for drugs. Contact: zhang@hlju.edu.cn
1 Introduction
Developing a new drug is a lengthy, complex, and expensive process which generally takes 10-15 years and 0.8-1.5 billon dollars (Dickson et al., 2004; Tamimi and Ellis, 2009; Pushpakom et al., 2018). Drug repositioning is to identify novel therapeutic effects for the drugs that have been approved by the regulatory agencies (Padhy and Gupta, 2011; Shahreza et al., 2017). The approved drugs have known and well-characterized bioavailability, safety and pharmacology which can significantly accelerate drug development. Compared to developing a drug de novo, drug repositioning may reduce the drug development period to 6.5 years and the cost for repositioning a drug is $300 million (Nosengo et al., 2016; Pritchard et al., 2017). Computational prediction of novel therapeutic indications for approved drugs may screen candidate drug-disease associations for further experimental validation (Hurle et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016). The previous works can be roughly grouped into two categories. Since the drugs execute their functions by targeting the related genes (Yamanishi et al., 2008; Bleakley et al., 2009; Fakhraei et al., 2014), the drugs and diseases that are associated with
each other are usually related to some common genes. Furthermore, the more common genes they are related to, the more likely that they are associated with each other. Thus, several methods of the first category are proposed to infer the association propensity of a drug and a disease based on their related genes or gene expressions (Sirota et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014a). Similarly, the association propensity can also be estimated according to the protein complexes shared by the drug and disease (Yu et al., 2015) and their common perturbed genes (Peyvandipour et al., 2018). However, these methods fail to be applied to the drugs and diseases without common interacted genes or proteins. The second category takes advantage of the various data that includes the similarities of drugs, diseases, and targets, as well as the interactions and associations between drugs, targets and diseases, for drug repositioning. The similarities of drugs and diseases are integrated by a kernel function to predict drug-disease associations (Wang et al., 2013). Several methods infer the candidate drug indications by information flow or random walks on a heterogeneous network composed of drugs, targets and diseases (Wang et al., 2014b; Luo et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2018). A couple of methods exploit the data of drugs and diseases and predict novel drug uses by a logistical regression model, a statistical model, sparse subspace learning, or similarity constrained matrix factorization (Gottlieb et al., 2011; Iwata et al.,

2015; Liang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a). In addition, recent researches indicated that besides proteins, the microRNAs and lncRNAs may also be used as the targets of drugs (Chen et al., 2018a; Qu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2015). Responses are also one kind of important attributes of drugs (Liu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b). Therefore, microRNAs, lncRNAs, and responses related to drugs, are potentially additional information for drug-disease association prediction. However, there are no enough experimentally verified microRNAs, lncRNAs, and responses so far for accurately predicting drug-related diseases. Overall, integrating the heterogeneous data from multiple sources is essential for exploring the drug-disease associations. However, these previous methods ignore the prior knowledge of drugs and diseases and the biological characteristic of drug-disease associations. In this article, we present DisDrugPred, a novel method for predicting the candidate drug-disease associations. We first calculate a new type of drug similarity based on the diseases that are associated with the drugs. DisDrugPred then completely exploits the similarity and association, as well as interaction data about drugs, diseases, and target proteins of drugs. DisDrugPred deeply integrates not only the diverse prior knowledge of drugs and diseases but also the projections of drugs and diseases in low-dimensional feature space. Integrating the prior knowledge about the case in which two drugs (diseases) will be more similar can capture the relationships between the drug-disease associations and the similarities of drugs (diseases) from the biological perspectives. Projecting the drugs and diseases into a common and low-dimensional feature space contributes to the measurement of the distances between them. These distances between drugs and diseases are also closely related to their association possibilities. Hence a unified model is constructed and an iterative optimization algorithm is developed for solving the model to obtain the association possibilities of drugs and diseases. The experimental results based on cross validation show that DisDrugPred significantly outperforms than several state-of-the-art prediction methods. In particular, when focusing on the top part of prediction result, DisDrugPred successfully retrieves more actual drug-disease associations. Case studies on 5 drugs further confirms that DisDrugPred is able to discover the potential disease indications of drugs.
2 Methods and Materials
Our goal is to predict the potential therapeutic indications, i.e., the candidate diseases, for a given drug of interest. We first calculate a new type of similarity between drugs to exploit the information of their associated diseases. A novel prediction model based on non-negative matrix factorization (Lee et al., 2001) is proposed by integrating the multi-source data about drugs and diseases. The drug-disease association scores are able to be obtained by solving the model with an iterative algorithm. A greater association score of drug ri and disease dj means that ri is more likely to be associated with dj.
2.1 Datasets for drug indication prediction
The associations between drugs and diseases, the chemical substructure profiles of drugs, the domain profiles of target proteins of drugs, the target annotation profiles of drugs, and the disease semantic similarities are obtained from the previous work on prediction of drug-disease associations (Liang et al., 2017). The 3051 drug-disease association data is originally extracted from the Unified Medical Language System (Bodenreider, 2004), and it contains the treatment relationships between 763 drugs and 681 diseases. The chemical substructure profile of drugs can be constructed by using the chemical fingerprints which are extracted from the database, PubChem (Kim et al., 2015 ). The domains of drug-related proteins and the gene ontology annotations of these proteins are respectively obtained from the databases, InterPro (Mitchell et al., 2015) and UniProt (Consortium, 2018). We extract the side effect indications of drugs from the Database SIDER (Kuhn et al., 2015), and 571 ones among 763 drugs have their side effect indications. The disease similarities that incorporated the disease ontology and the disease-related genes are extracted from the DincRNA database (Cheng et al., 2018), and 386 ones among 681 diseases have this kind of disease similarity. The disease names come from the U.S. National Library of Medicine (MeSH, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh).
2.2 Calculation and representation of multi-source data
Five types of drug similarities. As two drugs, such as ra and rb, with more common chemical substructures are usually more similar, the previous work LRSSL (Liang et al., 2017) calculates the cosine similarity on their chemical substructure vectors as the first type of similarity of ra and rb (Figure 1(a)). Moreover, the drugs with more common domains of target proteins or interacted with more target proteins with similar functions often have relatively higher similarity (Ding et al., 2013; Perlman et al., 2011). Hence LRSSL also calculated the second and third types of drug similarities based on cosine similarity measure. Since the drugs associated with similar diseases are also more similar, we additionally calculated the fourth type of similarity. Calculating the drug similarities based on the diseases associated with the drugs is part of the novelty of our work. Inspired by the miRNA similarity measure (Wang et al., 2010), we firstly obtain the disease sets related to drugs ra and rb, and denote them as DTa = {d1, d4} and DTb = {d2, d4, d5} (Figure 1(a)). The similarity between DTa and DTb is then calculated as the similarity of ra and rb which is denoted as RS(ra, rb). RS(ra, rb) is defined as,
RS(ra, rb) =
m
∑
i=1
max
1≤j≤n(DS(dai, dbj )) +
n
∑
j=1
max
1≤i≤m(DS(dbj , dai))
m + n , (1)
where DS(dai, dbj) is the semantic similarity of diseases dai and dbj which belong to DTa and DTb respectively. m and n are the numbers of diseases included by DTa and DTb. Matrix R4 ∈ <Nr×Nr is used to represent this type of drug similarity. < represents a set of real numbers and Nr is the number of drugs. <Nr×Nr is a real coordinate space with Nr × Nr dimensions. The disease semantic similarities are calculated by using the Wang’s method (Wang et al., 2010). The method constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for a disease that contains all of the semantic terms related to the disease, such as the DAG of Breast Neoplasms in Figure 1 (b). The similarity of two diseases is calculated based on their DAGs. The more their DAGs have common terms, the more similar two diseases are. The values of disease semantic similarity range between 0 and 1. Note that as only the disease semantic similarities cover all the diseases related with our interested drugs, the fourth type of drug similarity is just calculated based on these semantic similarities. In addition, drugs sharing more similar side effects tend to interact with common target proteins and further have more similar functions (Gottlieb et al., 2012; Sridhar et al., 2016; Zitnik et al., 2018). Thus the fifth type of drug similarity is measured by the cosine similarity based on the side effects related to the drugs. All of the five types of drug similarities are represented by the matrices R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 ∈ <Nr×Nr where (Rt)ij (1 ≤ t ≤ mr) is the tth type of similarity of drugs ri and rj, and mr is the number of the drug similarity types.
Representation of disease similarities. First, the semantic similarity of two diseases quantifies how similar the disease terms related to them are. Two diseases are generally more similar when they have more common terms. Wang et al. have calculated the disease semantic similarities (Wang et al., 2010), and these similarities are widely used by the previous work on drug-disease association prediction (Liang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a). Our method also exploit the disease similarities whose values range between 0 and 1. Second, the Disease Ontology (DO) has been developed as a formal ontology for human disease, and it aims to provide an etiological based disease classification (Schriml et al., 2018). Simultaneously, the functional similarity of two diseases may be measured by their related genes. Cheng et al. integrated the disease ontology and diseaserelated genes to obtain another type of disease similarity (Cheng et al., 2014). In our study, two types of disease similarities are denoted as the matrices D1 and D2 ∈ <Nd×Nd where (Ds)ij (1 ≤ s ≤ md) is the sth type of similarity of diseases di and dj, Nd is the numbers of diseases and md is the number of the disease similarity types (Figure 1(b)).
Representation of the drug-disease associations. As shown in Figure 1(c), the drug-disease bipartite graph is formed by the known associations between drugs and diseases. According to the graph, matrix A = (Aij) ∈ <Nd×Nr is constructed to represent the association case between Nd diseases and Nr drugs, where Aij is 1 if disease di was observed to be associated with drug rj or 0 otherwise.

(b) calculate two types of similarities between diseases and denote them with matrices. (c) construct the drug-disease association matrix A according to the known associations between drugs and diseases.
2.3 Drug-disease association prediction model
Modeling the drug-disease association relationships. Let P = (Pij) ∈ <Nd×Nr be the association score matrix, where Pij ≥ 0 is a score measuring how probably disease di is associated with drug rj. The observed drug-disease associations and the unobserved ones are represented by 1s and 0s, respectively. Since the non-zero elements of A are very sparse, the optimization item based on matrix factorization is often established based on the observed associations (Natarajan et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2018b; Zhao et al., 2018). Suppose Ω be the set of observed drug-disease associations, and Y = (Yij) ∈ <Nd×Nr be the indicator matrix where Yij is 1 if (di, rj) ∈ Ω or 0 otherwise. Obviously, Y is equal to A, and only the known drug-disease associations would contribute to the error term being minimized by using Y . The estimated association cases between drugs and diseases in P should be as consistent with the observed cases in A as possible. As a result, we construct an optimization term as follows,
min
P ≥0 ‖A (P − A)‖2
F , (2)
where ‖ · ‖2
F is the Frobenius norm of a matrix and is the Hadamard product. Modeling the projections of diseases and drugs. When the drugs and diseases are projected the common k-dimension feature space, it is more possible
that there is a potential association between a drug and a disease with similar low-dimensional features. Let Ws ∈ <Nd×k(1 ≤ s ≤ md) be the projection matrix of the sth type of disease similarity, and Ht ∈ <Nr×k(1 ≤ t ≤ mr) is the projection matrix corresponding to the tth type of drug similarity. As the close degrees between the k-dimension features of drugs and diseases DsWs(RtHt)T (1 ≤ s ≤ md, 1 ≤ t ≤ mr) offer a guidance for estimation of the drug-disease association scores, we add a new optimization term to the objective function,

where α1 is a parameter for making a tradeoff between the first optimal term and the second one.
Modeling the prior knowledge of disease similarities. It is well known that the more two diseases are associated similar drugs, the more similar they are. (Ds)ij in the disease similarity matrix Ds is the sth type of actual similarity between diseases di and dj. The ith row of matrix P , denoted as Pi, contains the possibilities that disease di is associated with the various drugs. In the transpose of P , i.e. P T , its jth column (P T )j contains the association possibilities between

disease dj and all the drugs. The expected similarities between the diseases, P P T , should be as close to the sth type of actual disease similarity in Ds as possible, which gives rise to the following function,

(4)
where α2 is used to control the contribution of the third term.
Modeling the prior knowledge of drug similarities. As mentioned before, the four types of drug similarities, i.e. R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5, reflect the similarities between the drugs from the different perspectives. The prior knowledge about the drug similarities is when two drugs are associated with more similar diseases, they usually have a higher similarity. In the drug-disease association score matrix P , the ith row of the transpose of P , (P T )i records the association possibilities between drug ri and the various diseases. The jth column of P , Pj, is the possibility column vector of drug rj to be associated with all the diseases. Then (P T )iPj is the expected similarity of ri and rj, while (R1)ij is the actual first type of similarity of these two drugs. The deviation between the expected drug similarities and the actual ones can be introduced as the fourth term to the optimization function,

where α3 is used to adjust the contribution of the term about the drug similarities. Modeling smoothness prior. The smoothness prior specifies that a drug and one of its k most similar neighbors are more often associated with two groups of similar diseases. Hence we respectively construct mr graphs composed of drug nodes according to mr types of drug similarities and construct a regularization term based these graphs, i.e., graph regularization term (Cai et al., 2011). For the tth (1 ≤ t ≤ mr) type of drug similarity, the adjacency matrix of its corresponding graph is Mt ∈ <Nr×Nr . Its element in the ith row and jth column, (Mt)ij, is defined as,
(Mt)ij =
{ 1, if the drug rj is one of the k most similar neighbors of the drug ri
0, otherwise . (6) Since a drug and its k similar neighbors are more likely to associate with more similar diseases, the following regularization term for smoothness can be constructed with the matrices Mt,

where pi and pj denote the ith and jth column vectors of matrix P respectively, and they reflect the cases that the drugs ri and rj are potentially associated with all the diseases. Ut ∈ <Nr×Nr is a diagonal matrix whose elements (Ut)ii =

(Mt)ij, and Lt = Ut − Mt is the Laplacian matrix of the tth graph. The
smoothness term should also be minimized and we have the following function,

(8)
where α4 regulates the contribution of the smoothness term.
Modeling the biological characteristic of associations. Only a limited number of diseases are associated with a specific drug, so each column of matrix P that records the association scores between the drug and all the diseases should be sparse. The l1-regularization is imposed on the columns of P for learning the sparse associations. After adding the sparse penalty term, we get the following function

Introducing regularization term for preventing overfitting. In order to prevent the overfitting in our prediction model, we add the l2-regularization on the projection matrices, Ws and Ht (1 ≤ s ≤ md, 1 ≤ t ≤ mr). We then get the final objective function L(P, Ws, Ht)

2.4 Optimization
As the objective function (10) with the variables P , Ws, and Ht is not convex, it is impractical to get its global minimum. We present an algorithm to find its local minimum by separating the optimization problem into several subproblems and then optimizing them iteratively. P -subproblem: When updating P with Ws and Ht (1 ≤ s ≤ md, 1 ≤ t ≤ mr) fixed, the subproblem for solving P is as follows,

The convergence curve of the objective function L(P, Ws, Ht), confirm that the function can converge to its local minima (Figure 2). L(P, Ws, Ht) is solved by iteratively using the updating rules of P , Ws, and Ht. The iterative process is over when the absolute difference of L(P, Ws, Ht) at two adjacent moments is less than a threshold (ε = 10−6) or the maximum number of iterations, 100, is reached. Finally, Pij is regarded as the estimated association score between disease di and drug rj (Figure 3).
3 Experimental evaluations and discussions
3.1 Evaluation metrics
We perform 5-fold cross-validation for evaluating the performance of a method in predicting drug-disease associations. All known drug-disease associations are randomly divided into 5 equal subsets, four of which are used for training a prediction model, while the remaining subset is used for evaluation. The associations in the remaining subset are added into the testing set and regarded as positive samples. The testing set also contains all the unobserved drug-disease associations which are regarded as negative samples. In the ranking list of associations, the higher the positive samples are ranked, the better the prediction

performance is. Note that association dataset is separated to 5 folds for crossvalidation, the fourth type of drug similarity is recomputed by only using the drug-disease associations used for training in each cross validation test. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC, Hajian-Tilaki, 2013) curve can be drawn with the true positive rates (TPRs) and the false positive rates (FPRs) at different ranking cutoffs. TPR is the proportion of positive samples identified correctly among the total positive samples, while FPR is the ratio of misidentified negative samples accounting for all the negative samples. TPR and FPR are defined as follows,
TPR = TP
TP +FN, FPR = FP
T N + F P , (23)
where T P and T N are the numbers of correctly identified positive and negative samples, and F N and F P are the numbers of positive and negative samples that are misidentified. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated to quantify the overall prediction performance. There is serious imbalance between the known drug-disease associations (positive samples) and the unobserved ones (negative samples). In such case, the precision-recall (PR) curve is more informative than the ROC curve (Saito T and Rehmsmeier M, 2015). Precision and recall are defined as,
P recision = T P
T P + F P , recall = T P
T P + F N . (24)
Precision is the proportion of the correctly identified positive samples among the retrieved samples, and recall is the same as TPR. We also evaluate the performance of association prediction by using PR curve and the area under PR curve (AUPR). In terms of 5-fold cross-validation, the final performance is obtained by using averaging CV. Averaging CV means that we obtain a separate performance (AUC or AUPR) for each of the 5 folds when used as a test set, and the 5 performances are averaged to give the final performance (Pahikkala et al., 2015). Considering the candidates in the top part of ranking list are usually selected by the biologists to further validate with wet-lab experiments, it is better to make the top part contain more positive samples. We thus calculate the recall rate within top part, which is the proportion of positive samples identified correctly in the top k list among the total positive ones, as another evaluation metric.
3.2 Comparison with other methods
To evaluate the performance of the presented method, DisDrugPred, we compare it with several state-of-the-art methods for drug-disease association prediction: TL_HGBI (Wang et al., 2014b), MBiRW (Luo et al., 2016), LRSSL (Liang et al., 2017) and SCMFDD (Zhang et al., 2018a). We describe these methods in more detail below: TL_HGBI (Wang et al., 2014b): TL_HGBI constructed the disease-drugtarget network and incorporated the drug similarities based on their chemical structures, the target similarities, the disease phenotypic similarities, the drugtarget interactions, and the disease-drug associations. It inferred the new disease-drug associations based on information flow in the three-layer network. TL_HGBI’s prediction model is listed as follows,
W k+1
dr = αW k
dr × (Wrr × W k
rt × Wtt × W kT
rr ) + (1 − α)W 0
dr, (25)
W k+1
rt = α(W kT
dr × Wdd × W k
dr × Wrr) × W k
rt + (1 − α)W 0
rt, (26)
where Wrr, Wtt, and Wdd are the weight matrices on the drug-drug links, the target-target links and the disease-disease links, respectively. W k
dr and W k
rt
are the weights of the disease-drug links and the drug-target links at the kth iteration. When the iterative information propagation is converged, Wdr contains the association possibilities between diseases and drugs. MBiRW (Luo et al., 2016): MBiRW constructed a drug-disease network by exploiting the drug similarities based on their chemical substructures, the disease semantic similarities, and the drug-disease associations. The association propensities between drugs and diseases are obtained by random walks on the drug network and the disease network, respectively. The prediction model of MBiRW is defined as follows,
Rr = α ∗ M R ∗ RDt−1 + (1 − α) ∗ A, (27)
Rd = α ∗ RDt−1 ∗ M D + (1 − α) ∗ A, (28)
where M R and M D are the transition matrices corresponding to the drug and disease networks, A is the drug-disease association matrix, and RDt−1 contains the drug-disease association scores at time t − 1. MBiRW combined

RDt = (rf lag ∗ Rr + df lag ∗ Rd)/(rf lag + df lag), (29)
where rf lag and df lag are used to balance the contributions of the drug and disease networks. LRSSL (Liang et al., 2017): The method uses more data about the drugs in training than TL_HGBI, MBiRW, and SCMFDD. It regards the chemical substructure profiles of the drugs, the target domain profiles, and the target annotation profiles as the drug node attributes, respectively. It also exploits the known drug-disease associations and the local topological structure of graph composed of all the drugs. Its objective function is defined as follows,

(30) where Xp represents the pth type of drug node attribute, Y is the drug-disease association matrix, and L is the Laplacian matrix of drug graph. Gp is used to project each type of drug node attribute to a space whose dimension is equal to the number of diseases, which is also helpful for solving the drug-disease association scores in F . SCMFDD (Zhang et al., 2018a): SCMFDD focuses on the drug-disease associations, the disease semantic similarities, and the drug similarities based on their substructures. It factorizes the drug-disease association relationships into the low-rank drug and disease feature vectors xi and yj as follows,

Furthermore, the drug and disease similarities wd

j is the estimated association score between the ith disease and the jth drug. DisDrugPred’s hyperparameters, α1 ∼ α6, should be tuned and their values are selected from {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50}. DisDrugPred yields the best performance when α1=10, α2=10, α3=0.1, α4=10, α5=10, and α6=10, and the optimal set of parameters was obtained by using grid search. To make fair comparisons, the hyperparameters of the other methods are set to their optimal
values suggested by their literatures (i.e. α = 0.4 and β = 0.3 for TL_HGBI, α = 0.3, l = 2 and r = 2 for MBiRW, μ = 0.01, λ = 0.01, γ = 2, and k = 10 for LRSSL, k = 45%, μ = 1 and λ = 4 for SCMFDD). In addition, the sensitivity coefficients (SC, van Riel et al., 2006) of DisDrugPred’s 6 parameters are evaluated by changing one of parameters and fixing the remaining ones. The SC values of α1 ∼ α6 are 5.23e-04, 0.0148, 0.0121, 0.0032, 0.0191, and 7.38e-05, respectively. Hence DisDrugPred is not sensitive to the perturbation of α1, α4, and α6, while α2, α3, and α5 have relatively greater impacts on DisDrugPred. As AUC and AUPR are the better metrics in comparing learning algorithms with probability estimations (Ling et al., 2003, Saito T and Rehmsmeier M, 2015), we use them to evaluate DisDrugPred and the other methods. The ROC curves and their corresponding AUCs obtained by different approaches are given in Figure 4(A). DisDrugPred_with_R4 and LRSSL_with_R4 are the instances of DisDrugPred and LRSSL which exploit four types of drug similarities, i.e., R1, R2, R3, and R4. DisDrugPred_with_R4 achieves the highest average AUC over all of the 763 drugs (AUC=0.922). It outperforms TL_HGBI by 19.5%, MBiRW by 7.1%, LRSSL with R4 by 7%, and SCMFDD by 28.4%. As shown in Figure 4(B), DisDrugPred_with_R4 also produces the highest average AUPR on 763 drugs (AUPR=0.143). Its’ AUPR is 11.3%, 9.9%, 3.6%, and 13.7% better than TL_HGBI, MBiRW, LRSSL_with_R4, and SCMFDD, respectively. LRSSL_with_R4 yields the second best performance. Its’ AUC is slightly better than MBiRW while its’ AUPR is 6.3% higher than MBiRW. SCMFDD did not perform as well as the other methods as it is very sensitive to the disease and drug similarities. DrugDisPred_with_R4 and LRSSL_with_R4 utilize multiple types of drug similarities, while the other methods focus on only one type of drug similarity. These two methods show the better performances over the other methods, which indicates that integrating more types of drug similarities is essential for improving the prediction accuracy. In addition, the instances of DisDrugPred and LRSSL are constructed by using R1, R2, R3, R4, and the fifth type of drug similarity based on their side effects (R5), and they are referred to as DisDrugPred_side_effect and LRSSL_side_effect. The former still performs better than the latter in terms of both AUC and AUPR, which confirms the superiority of DisDrugPred’s algorithm. Since only 571 ones of 763 drugs have their side effects, the subsequent analysis still concentrates on DisDrugPred_with_R4 and LRSSL_with_R4 which cover all of 763 drugs. For all the prediction results on 763 drugs, we perform a Wilcoxon test to evaluate whether DisDrugPred’s performance is significantly better than the other methods. The statistical results (Table 1) indicate that DisDrugPred yields the significantly better performance under the p-value threshold of 0.05 in terms of not only AUCs but AUPRs as well.

The higher the recall rate on the top k ranked potential drug-disease associations is, the more the real associations are identified successfully. DisDrugPred performs better than the other methods at various k cutoffs (Figure 5), and ranks 70.5% in top 30, 84.5% in top 90, and 89.4% in top 150. Although the AUC of LRSSL is very close to that of MBiRW, all of the recall rates of LRSSL are higher than MBiRW. The former ranks 61.8%, 76.2%, and 80.7% in top 30, 90, and 150, respectively, and the latter ranks 47%, 68.3%, and 76.8%. TL_HGBI is not as good as MBiRW, and it ranks 37%, 51.7%, and 61.8% in top 30, 90, and 150. SCMFDD still did not perform as well as the other methods and the corresponding recall rates are 12.5%, 28.4%, and 40.8%.
3.3 Importance of the drug similarities, the disease similarities, and DisDrugPred’s algorithm
To validate the importance of incorporating the fourth type of drug similarity (R4), two DisDrugPred’s instances, DisDrugPred_with_R4 and DisDrugPred_without_R4, are constructed. The former is trained with R4, while the latter is trained without R4. At the same time, since LRSSL is able to be extended to exploit more types of drug similarities, we also construct two LRSSL’s instances that are trained with R4 and without R4, LRSSL_with_R4 and LRSSL_without_R4, respectively. First, the instances of DisDrugPred and LRSSL with R4 perform better than the ones without R4, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). DisDrugPred_with_R4’s AUC and AUPR are 1.9% and 1.9% higher than DisDrugPred_without_R4. LRSSL_with_R4’s AUC and AUPR also increase by 5.1% and 1.9% compared with LRSSL_without_R4. It shows the importance of incorporating the drug similarities R4 for improving prediction performance. Second, the performances of DisDrugPred’s instances are better than LRSSL’s instances whenever their models are trained by using R4 or not (Supplementary Figure 1). DisDrugPred_with_R4 achieves 7% and 3.6% higher AUC and AUPR than LRSSL_with_R4. DisDrugPred_without_R4’s AUC and AUPR also increase by 10.2% and 3.6% compared with LRSSL_without_R4. It confirms that the algorithm of DisDrugPred also help with the improvement of prediction performance. In addition, to evaluate the effect of exploiting multiple types of disease similarities, an instance of DisDrugPred is constructed by using the first and second type of disease similarities (D1 and D2), and is referred to as DisDrugPred_with_D2. Another DisDrugPred’s instance is trained without D2, and is named DisDrugPred_without_D2. Since the
other methods just exploit D1 and they are not available for using both D1 and D2, we only estimate DisDrugPred’s performance. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, DisDrugPred_with_D2’s AUPR is a little bit higher than DisDrugPred_without_D2 and it increases by 0.3%, while DisDrugPred_with_D2’s AUC is equal to DisDrugPred_without_D2’s one. It indicates D2 has a slight effect on the prediction performances.
3.4 Case studies on 5 drugs
To further demonstrate DisDrugPred’s ability to discover the potential drugdisease associations, case studies on 5 drugs, ciprofloxacin, clonidine, ampicillin, etoposide, and cefotaxime, are conducted. For each of these 5 drugs, the candidate drug-disease associations are prioritized by their association scores, and the top 10 candidates are collected, 50 candidates in total (Table 2). First, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) provides the key information about the drugs and their effects on human diseases which were manually curated from the published literatures (Davis et al., 2016). DrugBank is also a database that captures the clinical trial information of drugs including the drug and the disease for which the trial was conducted (Wishart et al., 2017). The repoDB database records the approved and failed drugs and their respective indications (Brown et al., 2017). As shown in Table 2, 29 candidates are contained by CTD and they are supported by the direct evidences, 13 candidates are included by DrugBank, and 1 candidate is recorded by repoDB. It indicates these candidate diseases are indeed associated with the corresponding drugs. Next, ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) is an online resource provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and it includes a great many clinical trials about various drugs and the corresponding diseases. PubChem is an open chemistry database supported by the National Institutes of Health (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and it provides information on chemical substances which include the drugs and their biological activities (Kim et al., 2015). There are 4 candidates included by ClinicalTrials.gov and 2 candidates contained by PubChem, indicating these drug-disease associations are supported by the clinical trials. In addition, the 4 candidates labeled by "literature" are supported by the literatures, and the drugs are confirmed to have effects on the corresponding diseases. Besides the manually curated drug-disease associations, the CTD database also contains the potential associations inferred by the literatures. There is 1 etoposide-related candidate disease, Urinary Tract Infections, contained by the inferred part of CTD. Hence etoposide is more likely to be associated with

Urinary Tract Infections. In the total 50 candidates, 2 of them are not confirmed by the observed evidences and they are labeled with "unconfirmed". All the case studies indicate that DisDrugPred is indeed capable of discovering potential candidate drug-disease associations.
3.5 Prediction of novel drug-disease associations
After having evaluated its prediction performance by cross validation and case studies, we applied DisDrugPred to predict the novel drug-disease associations. All of the known drug-disease associations were utilized to train DisDrugPred’s prediction model. The potential candidate associations were then obtained by using the model and listed in supplementary table ST1. In addition, the fourth type of drug similarity based on their associated diseases is shown in supplementary table ST2.
4 Conclusions
A method based on non-negative matrix factorization, DisDrugPred, is developed for predicting the potential drug-disease associations. On the basis of calculating the fourth type of drug similarity, DisDrugPred captures the various intrarelationships of drugs and diseases, i.e., the 5 types of drug similarities and 2 types of disease similarities. Meanwhile, it also captures the inter-relationships among drugs and diseases, i.e., the known drug-disease associations. Moreover, the various prior knowledge and the projections of drugs and diseases are deeply integrated to enhance reasoning on the drug-disease associations. In addition, the experimental results confirm DisDrugPred’s algorithm also contributes to its’ superior performance. An iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the estimated drug-disease association scores, and these scores can be used for ranking the candidate diseases for each of the drugs. In our experiments, we find DisDrugPred consistently outperforms than the other methods tested here in terms of not only AUCs but also AUPRs. In particular, DisDrugPred is more useful for the biologists as its top ranking list contains more real drug-disease associations. Case studies on five drugs demonstrate DisDrugPred’s ability in discovering the potential disease indications. DisDrugPred can serve as a prioritization tool to generate the reliable candidates for subsequent identification of actual drug-disease associations with the wet-lab experiments.
