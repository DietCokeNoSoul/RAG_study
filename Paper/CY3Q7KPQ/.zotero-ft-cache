Abstract—Specific emitter identification (SEI) plays an important role in secure Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In recent years, many SEI methods based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been proposed due to their great performance. However, DL-based SEI methods are accompanied by huge computation overhead, which is not suitable for IIoT applications. In addition, the existing ML-based SEI methods rely on feature extraction and a heavy and redundant classifier, which do not ensure optimal feature combination and efficient computation. To solve the above problem, we propose an improved DL-based SEI method using a signal feature embedded knowledge graph (KG) composed of universal features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply KG for SEI technology. Specifically, we explore an adaptive feature combination (AFC) strategy through the attention mechanism to realize an efficient SEI classifier. The simulation results show that the proposed KG-AFC algorithm outperforms existing SEI methods in identification performance and computation overhead. At the same time, under the optimal compression rate, the average accuracy of the proposed SEI algorithm is higher than 99.2% and can effectively reduce complexity.

in Industrial IoT (IIoT). The data stream in IIoT is characterized by large volume, strong real-time, and diversified information transmission [1], [2], [3], which is difficult to identify and classify. This will affect subsequent applications such as fault detection, and further pose a threat to the security of wireless communication. With the development of specific emitter identification (SEI), SEI can use the unique radio frequency (RF) fingerprint of the emitter to measure the characteristics of the received RF and determine the emitter generating the signal according to the existing prior information, thus realizing the classification and identification of the data stream. It can be seen that SEI [4], [5] is of great significance in the field of IIoT. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have made great achievements in the field of signal processing, such as automatic modulation recognition [6], [7], [8], [9], channel state information prediction and feedback [10], [11], malware traffic classification [12], [13], [14], flight delay prediction [15], and other applications. Nevertheless, these SEI methods based on ML or DL all require accurate data to operate, and their convergence is not good for data with large sample distribution deviation, multiple categories, and multiple targets. In addition, the transferability of the results of DL has certain limitations, and the results of training are difficult to apply to other problems. For the ML method, it is difficult to get the best performance through the adaptive method. Meanwhile, to extract sufficient but minimal information from the data, manual selection of effective features is chosen to reduce the number of features in the linear model [16], [17], [18]. However, this method is inefficient in dealing with large amounts of data and performs poorly in terms of identification accuracy. More importantly, this method relies heavily on abundant prior knowledge from experts. For this reason, we consider combining the adaptive feature combination (AFC) algorithm with DL. The existing SEI methods only pay attention to the single data set, without in-depth feature mining and also without considering the best combination of features. In addition, for RF signals, there is no library related to their features currently. However, building such a knowledge library of RF signal features can help provide valuable information reference for RF signal identification, and it can make the signal features more portable. The knowledge graph (KG)

technology has the above advantages. KG is essentially the knowledge library of semantic network, and has the ability to formalize complex and scattered knowledge, and can realize fast semantic search [19]. Through the four steps of data mining, information processing, knowledge measurement, and graphic rendering, this technology can effectively represent the relationships between different entities and can analyze semantics to the greatest extent [20]. Furthermore, it realizes the visualization of information, which greatly reduces the obstacles for users to quickly create effective data visualization [21]. Last but not least, it gives semantic meaning to data and further improves the efficiency and interpretability of information. Therefore, this article considers introducing the KG into the SEI technique and proving its feasibility [22]. Therefore, in the complex environment of the IIoT, for multisource signals with large amount of data and strong real time, this article aims to propose an SEI based on adaptive signal feature embedded KG. The main contributions of this article are highlighted as follows. 1) To solve the problem of manual selection of effective features from several signal features, this article uses AFC block to achieve the best feature combination strategy. The AFC block analogizes signal features as different channels and then obtains the best weight of each feature. 2) In this article, different compression rates are considered in the process of the AFC block, which can achieve the best balance between the identification performance and the computation overhead. 3) To deal with the visual representation and storage of signal features, this article innovatively constructs a KG for signal features with the help of Neo4j [23]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply KG to SEI technology. Note: The main symbols in this article are listed in Table I.
II. RELATED WORKS
In this section, we provide an overview of existing SEI methods, as shown in Table II, including traditional methods based on ML, and automatic methods based on DL. More so, we make a review of several KG classification methods for different tasks.
A. ML-Based SEI Methods
ML-based methods were first proposed for SEI. For the most universal discrete data, the supervised ML method has become the first choice of many scholars. Zhou et al. [24] proposed a new cluster-based k-nearest neighbor (kNN) method. This method uses the new kNN algorithm to classify and dynamically adjust the number of neighborhood k in each iteration, which solves the problem of low classification accuracy when the training samples are uneven. Guo et al. [25] used support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) to identify relevant features with great impact from multisource remote sensing data. The authors confirm that the optimal SVM model based on feature selection improves the identification accuracy through feature selection. The structured SVM proposed by Zhang and Piccardi [26] is an extension of SVM, which
TABLE I MAIN SYMBOLS IN THIS ARTICLE
is used to jointly predict structured labels from multiple measurements, effectively realizing the classification of two challenging data sets. Unfortunately, existing SVM methods are often used in binary classification situations, so it is difficult to apply them to handle multiclassification problems. Gupta et al. [27] innovatively proposed the use of OneVsRest classifier on the basis of SVM, which achieves great success in multiclassification problems. Moreover, Wang et al. [28] proposed a novel FS-SEI method based on deep metric ensemble learning (DMEL). Metric learning with a complexvalued convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for feature embedding to extract distinguishable features with compact intraclass distance and separable interclass distance. However, the above ML-based SEI methods are very sensitive to the missing data and often result in a slight lack of accuracy.
B. DL-Based SEI Methods
In the past decade, with the great success of DL in the field of image processing, scholars have gradually applied it to signal processing, especially SEI. Hu et al. [29] proposed the squeeze-and-excitation network, which can adaptively recalibrate the channel feature correspondence by modeling the interdependencies between channels to significantly improve CNN performance. Merchant et al. [30] took the lead in designing a CNN to detect physical features for the identification of cognitive radio devices, and the method showed great transferability and robustness. Baldini and Giuliani [31] further considered CNN for SEI tasks and proposed a DL method based on stacked neural networks for classification.

TABLE II RELATED WORKS ON ML-BASED SEI METHODS AND DL-BASED SEI METHODS
Fig. 1. Flowchart of the SEI method based on adaptive signal feature embedded KG. The data collection process collects the received RF signal and converts it into sample data in a universal format through preprocessing; the feature extraction process extracts the required features and feeds them into the KG-AFC architecture to achieve AFC and visualization; and finally, the SEI task is implemented based on the feature classification results.
With the fast development of SEI technology, more DLbased methods have been gradually emerging for better performance. To deal with the high computational complexity of deep convolution neural network (DCNN), Gan et al. [32] proposed a DCNN-based SNR sensing adaptive scalable SEI algorithm to improve efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Wang et al. [5] proposed a novel DL model called real-valued convolution neural network (RVCNN), which has been applied in SEI to directly process complex baseband signals and improve identification performance. What is more, Zhang et al. [33] proposed a multiscale convolution neural network (MSCNN) of three branches with different convolution kernel sizes, which can improve the absolute accuracy by 15% and the relative accuracy by 22% for SEI tasks. Although the above DL-based SEI methods can effectively improve the identification accuracy of the model, it is difficult to achieve the migration of model features, and the portability is relatively poor. In addition, for large-scale data, the above DL-based SEI methods will generate a large amount of computation overhead, which is a problem we need to avoid as much as possible.
C. KG Classification Methods
KG has gained significant identification in the field of data classification. Menglong et al. [34] proposed a semantic thinning method based on KG to analyze the relationship between similar categories in images from the perspective of semantic knowledge. Xiao et al. [35] proposed a model based on the multiview clustering framework to generate the
semantic representation of knowledge elements (i.e., entities/relationships). This model can effectively implement the classification and retrieval of entities. Lan et al. [36] proposed using a large Chinese medical KG to derive medical knowledge, and using graph neural network (GNN) to make the best use of these knowledge, which enhanced the interaction of knowledge and improved the performance of text classification. Huang et al. [37] proposed a graph knowledge transfer mechanism (GKtran) to solve the limited degree of learning from a short text. This method combines the GNN model to achieve effective graph classification by constructing a word weight. Although existing KG classification methods can fully utilize the rich association information between entities, attributes, and relationships for more accurate classification, most of them are processed based on semantic information, which makes it difficult for a single KG classification method to flexibly migrate and expand when facing new fields or tasks.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
This article aims to propose a fast and effective SEI method to realize the identification of RF signals in the IIoT environment. As shown in Fig. 1, the SEI system consists of four parts: 1) data collection; 2) feature extraction; 3) KG-AFC architecture; and 4) emitter identification. First, the emitter signal-acquiring device is used to collect the received RF signal and then proceed to data preprocessing. Second, the sample data with a universal format is extracted through a series of

HUA et al.: SPECIFIC EMITTER IDENTIFICATION USING ADAPTIVE SIGNAL FEATURE EMBEDDED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH 4725
feature extractors. After that, the features are taken as the input of the KG-AFC architecture, thus it can generate a visual KG. Moreover, the attention mechanism is used to process the feature nodes, so that the computational resources are biased toward valuable and meaningful features. Finally, according to the feature identification results, unauthorized illegal devices are found.
B. Problem Formulation
Based on the system model above and the signal data set, the received RF signal in this article can be expressed as
xi(t) = si(t) + ni(t), i = 1, 2, . . . , N (1)
where xi(t) represents the received RF signal, si(t) represents the RF signal input to the channel after modulation, and ni(t) represents the additive white Gaussian noise. It is well known that SEI technology is essential to solve the matching problem between the received RF signal and the corresponding label [38], [39], [40]. This article assumes that the data set is defined as {xi, yi}N
i=1, where yi represents the label corresponding to different emitters, then the SEI problem to be solved can be defined as
ˆyi = fSEI
(xi
(t), W ̃ ), i = 1, 2, . . . , N (2)
where yˆi represents the prediction of xi, fSEI(·) represents the
model mapping function, and W ̃ represents the optimal feature weight coefficient. In addition, this article defines the accuracy rate, which is expressed as
α= 1
N
{ N ∑
i=1
(yˆi = yi
)}
. (3)
From the definition of accuracy rate, the corresponding error rate can be expressed as ξ = 1 − α. Therefore, the objective function to be optimized can be defined as
W ̃ = arg mWi0n
ξ {yˆi = fSEI(xi, W0), yi
}. (4)
The optimal feature weight coefficient W ̃ is obtained by adjusting the feature weight coefficient W0 and fSEI(·) framework. Thus, we can achieve the minimum error rate ξmin of SEI tasks.
IV. PROPOSED SEI METHOD USING KG-AFC ARCHITECTURE
Presently, most SEI methods are based on the ML algorithm. However, the classification accuracy of the mainstream ML-based SVM algorithm for large-scale training samples is far from that of the SEI method based on the DL-based algorithm, which has approximately 1%–7% performance increase in SEI task [41]. Meanwhile, the ML method needs to manually select effective features when facing a large number of features, and the training method is complex and cumbersome. Therefore, this article proposes the DL-based KG-AFC architecture, which can be used for SEI. In this section, the proposed SEI method using KG-AFC architecture is introduced in detail, including the feature extraction, the generation of KG, visualization, and the AFC block in KG-AFC architecture.
A. Feature Extraction
For RF signals, there are two main types of features that are most commonly used and effective, namely, time-domain features and frequency-domain features [42], [43]. In addition, due to the significant influence of frequency features on RF signals, spectral kurtosis can detect and characterize the nonstationary nature of the signal, effectively identifying transient shocks and their distribution in the frequency band from signals containing background noise, and is an effective supplement to frequency features [44]. Therefore, in the feature extraction section of this article, the most commonly used time-domain features, frequency-domain features, and spectral kurtosis features are selected. In this article, the mean, variance, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, fourth-order cumulant, sixth-order cumulant, maximum, minimum, median, peak-to-peak, rectified mean value, mean-square value, root mean-square, root mean-square amplitude, waveform factor, peak factor, pulse factor, clearance factor, etc., are selected as the signal features extracted in the time domain. Moreover, gravity frequency, mean-square frequency, root mean-square frequency, frequency variance, frequency standard deviation, etc., are selected as the signal features extracted in the frequency domain. Last but not least, the mean value of spectral kurtosis, standard deviation of spectral kurtosis, kurtosis of spectral kurtosis, skewness of spectral kurtosis, etc., are selected as extracted spectral kurtosis features to construct the RF signal KG. 1) Higher Order Cumulant: We extract the characteristics of commonly used fourth-order cumulants and sixth-order cumulants. The extraction principle is shown below. A received signal with noise is shown in (1), where s(t) is represented by
s(t) =
[
Am
∑
n
ang(t − nTs)
]
cos(2π fct + φ(t))
= sI(t) cos(2π fct) − sQ(t) sin(2π fct) (5)
where Am, an, Ts, fc, and φ(t) represent modulation amplitude, symbol sequence, symbol period, carrier frequency, and phase, respectively. The expression for g(t) is
g(t) =
{ 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ Ts
0, otherwise. (6)
According to the Euler formula of the complex function ejx = cos(x) + j sin(x), the received signal with noise can be represented in complex form as
x(t) = A
∑
n
ang(t − nTs) exp[j(ωct + θc)] + n(t) (7)
where A represents the modulation amplitude after formula transformation and the angular frequency formula ωc = 2π fc is used for conversion. The signal is downconverted and sampled, and the resulting sequence can be expressed as
xi = Aejθ ai + ni, i = 1, 2, . . . , N (8)
where N represents the length of xi. Let Mim be the mixed
moment, which can be defined as Mim = E[xi−m(x∗)i] [45],

4726 IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL, VOL. 11, NO. 3, 1 FEBRUARY 2024
where i is the current order of the moment. The cumulant of the signal xi is defined as
Cim(x) = Cum
⎡
⎢⎣ x, . . . , x
} {{ }
(i−m) times
, x∗, . . . , x∗
} {{ }
m times
⎤
⎥⎦. (9)
Hence, through the above equation, it is easy to obtain the mathematical relationship between cumulants and moments, which is expressed as
Cum(x1, . . . , xn) = ∑

(p − 1)!(−1)p−1 ∏
v∈
E
(∏
i∈v
xi
)
(10)
where  ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}; v represents the list member in the collection ; and p is the number of elements in the collection . However, what we need to consider is that given the signal x with N samples, in this case, the expression of the estimated moment becomes
̂Mim(x) = 1
N
N ∑
k=1
xi−m(i)x∗m(k). (11)
Therefore, without losing generality, it is assumed that the normalized signal x has unit energy, i.e., C21 = 1. In practice, the self-normalized higher order moments (HOMs) and higher order cumulants (HOCs) can be calculated as
M ̃ im(x) = Mˆ im(x)/Mˆ i/2
21 (x) (12)
C ̃ im(x) = Cˆ im(x)/Cˆ i/2
21 (x). (13)
2) Kurtosis and Skewness: We use kurtosis and skewness to the steepness and asymmetry of signal distribution, respectively. The kurtosis can be defined as
K=1
n
∑n
i=1
[( Xi − μ σ
)4]
(14)
where μ is the mean value of the population; and σ is the standard deviation. The range of kurtosis is [1, +∞). Moreover, the skewness can be defined as
S= 1
n
∑n
i=1
[( Xi − μ σ
)3]
(15)
where μ is the mean value of the population; and σ is the standard deviation. The range of skewness is (−∞, +∞). When the mean and standard deviation of the population are difficult to obtain, the mean X and standard deviation s of the sample can be used instead. Generally speaking, the absolute value of skewness exceeds 0.5, which means that skewness is very large. 3) Gravity Frequency: The gravity frequency is similar to the centroid coordinate of a point in a stationary random process, which can effectively reflect the distribution of the signal power spectrum. The definition is as follows:
S1 =
∑N
k=1 fk · P(k)
∑N
k=1 P(k) (16)
where P(k) is the corresponding power spectrum value, and fk is the frequency amplitude of the corresponding point. When the low-frequency amplitude is large, the center of gravity is close to the origin.
4) Mean-Square Frequency and Root Mean-Square Frequency: The mean-square frequency is similar to the moment of inertia in a stationary random process, which can effectively reflect the weighted average of the square of the signal frequency. The root mean-square frequency is its arithmetic square root. Hence, the definition of both can be expressed as
S2 =
∑N
k=1 f 2
k · P(k)
∑N
k=1 P(k) (17)
S3 =
√√√√
∑N
k=1 f 2
k · P(k)
∑N
k=1 P(k) . (18)
5) Data Normalization: In order to ensure that the extracted features have the same measurement scale, it is necessary to normalize the features. The normalized features are
x′ = X − min
max − min (19)
where X is the data set after feature extraction; min is the minimum value in the data set; max is the maximum value in the data set; and x′ represents the data set of the final output after normalization.
B. KG-AFC Architecture
After extracting the signal features of the real part and the imaginary part of the collected original RF signal, respectively, 56 RF signal features are obtained. This article further proposes the KG-AFC architecture that can be used for SEI tasks. This section introduces the generation and visualization process of KG and the adaptive feature selection by AFC block. 1) Generation of KG: The RF signal KG is based on the RF signal feature library. To realize data sharing and data centralized control, before generating the KG, the signal features x′ are imported into the MySQL database to generate the RF signal feature library. Based on the RF signal feature library, the RF KG is generated by artificially establishing the relationship between entities and attributes using prior expert knowledge, the specific method is: we choose the form of “RF signal − time-domain features − feature parameter” and “RF signal − frequency-domain features − feature parameter” to form the corresponding “entity − attribute” format, taking the timedomain features and frequency-domain features as entities, and taking their corresponding feature parameters as subsidiary attributes to connect the relationship between entities through attributes. For example, the “time-domain features” entity and the “mean” attribute connect the entities and attributes through the “mean: real part” relationship, forming a simple triple format. This construction method is not only conducive to the systematic characterization of data but also facilitates the subsequent SEI and analysis. 2) Visualization: Due to the visualization assistance of KG enhances the model’s representation ability and further expands the application boundaries of KG, we use Neo4j

HUA et al.: SPECIFIC EMITTER IDENTIFICATION USING ADAPTIVE SIGNAL FEATURE EMBEDDED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH 4727
to visualize the relationships between various entities and attributes. At the same time, MySQL Workbench is used to realize the visualization of various discrete feature value, which is convenient for subsequent addition, deletion, and modification of data. 3) AFC Block: The AFC block adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels. We use this method of adding an attention mechanism in the channel dimension, i.e., AFC block, to obtain the importance of the feature channel (the channel dimension in this article is the extracted feature). After that, use this importance to assign different weights to each feature channel. Thus, the weight of features useful for the current SEI task is increased, and the weight of features not useful for it is suppressed, so as to achieve the purpose of adaptive signal features. In this article, the specific use of AFC block is shown in Fig. 2. First, perform the squeeze and compress the 2-D features (H × W) of each channel into a real number through average pooling. After the squeeze, the dimension becomes 1×1×C, where C represents the number of features in the feature extraction module. That is to say, z ∈ RC is the result of the global average pooling of features in the spatial dimension H × W, which can be expressed as
z = Fsq
(x′) = 1
H×W
H ∑
m=1
W ∑
n=1
x′(m, n). (20)
Second, to fully capture the dependencies between features, we have to require the architecture to be able to learn the nonlinear relationships between channel features and to enhance the multiple channel features that we hope to be effective. Based on this, we choose to use a simple gating mechanism with sigmoid activation. We map and transform feature vectors through two FCs. Among them, the number of neurons in the first FC needs to be divided by a reduction ratio, which represents the compression ratio. Thus, the following transformation form is adopted:
s = Fex(z, W) = σ (g(z, W)) = σ (W2δ(W1z)) (21)
where z is the output of squeeze; W1 is an FC operation with
W1 ∈ RC/r×C; δ represents the Relu operation; W2 is also an
FC operation with W2 ∈ RC×C/r; g(z, W) represents two FC operations; and σ represents the sigmoid operation. Through the two FC nonlinear operations, the correlation between features can be used to train the true scale. In addition, the first FC compresses C channels into C/r channels, which can reduce the amount of computation. By this method, we can achieve the balance between the overall performance and the amount of computation. Finally, the weight vector obtained is multiplied with the channel to complete the introduction of the attention mechanism in the channel dimension is given as
 ̃x = Fscale
(x′, s) = s × x′. (22)

18 W∗ = Wn;
19 n∗ = n;
20 s = sn; 21 end 22 end 23 return s
24 Multiply the obtained weight matrix s with the channel feature to obtain the final feature x ̃ through (22).
C. Summary and Workflow
In summary, the SEI method using KG-AFC based on adaptive signal feature embedded KG can intuitively represent extracted features through KG. In addition, the AFC strategy can be realized through the feature weight layer based on the attention mechanism. Most importantly, it can achieve a balance between performance and computation overhead. The workflow of the proposed KG-AFC is shown in Algorithm 1. For the convenience of understanding the algorithm, we use a sample as an example and explain the operation process in conjunction with Algorithm 1. First, input the sample into the feature extraction module, which includes common multidomain features of RF signals, and normalize them to obtain the output x′. Next, utilizing expert prior knowledge, input the obtained output x′ into KG and obtain the corresponding visualization graph in Neo4j. Afterward, AFC is performed on the output data through the channel attention mechanism. First, compress the global spatial information using (20) to obtain the output z. Second, the dimension reduction and effective features are selected by two FCs, and different weight matrices s corresponding to different features are obtained. Finally, the weight matrix s is multiplied by the original features to obtain the adaptive optimal feature  ̃x.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We will introduce data set generation and parameter settings, feature library and KG construction results, and simulation results for the SEI task. We then give some analysis and discussion about the results, including performance, complexity, and influence of different compression ratios in the AFC block.
A. Data Set Generation and Parameter Settings
The data set used in this article is a continuous signal sample generated by the collection device. As shown in Fig. 3, the collection device consists of a signal generator (VSG60A), a signal receiver (BB60C), two personal computers (PCs), and a target power amplifier (PA) [46], [47]. One of the PCs is connected to VSG60A via USB 3.0 to observe the original signal waveform generated by VSG60A. Then, the signal is sent to PA, which can effectively utilize the amplification effect of the internal transistor to achieve continuous current amplification and complete power amplification. Further enhanced the function of the collected signal. Next, the signal passes through a real communication environment and is collected by BB60C. Finally, add noise to the received signal and normalize it. At this point, the entire signal collection process has been completed. We consider using VSG60A and BB60C as signal generators and receivers in this article, respectively. Its brief introduction and implementation functions are as follows: the VSG60A RF vector signal source can generate a variety of RF signal with different modulation modes to satisfy different functions. The frequency range is as high as 6 GHz, which can easily meet the requirements of different modulation modes of signal. In this article, we choose the commonly used modulation method of 16PSK, which can generate multiple modulation types of signal based on VSG60A. In future work, we will consider using it to generate more diverse RF signal and explore SEI problems in multitask scenarios. BB60C is a 6-GHz real-time spectrum analyzer module and RF recorder, capable of 250 kHz–27 MHz variable acquisition of IQ data and amplitude correction. We use BB60C to convert the

received signal into a digital signal and transmit it to a PC for normalization processing and slicing. To create a unified generalized feature database, we referred to the data paradigm proposed by Tu et al. [48], and set the number of individual samples to 12 000. Considering that the longer the reading length of a single sample, the smaller the ratio of the absolute value of error to the measured value, and the higher the identification accuracy, we set the reading length of a single sample as 12 000. In addition, in practical applications, due to the complexity of the signal and its higher harmonic frequency, the sampling frequency should be set higher and the sampling points should be more dense, making the obtained discrete signal closer to the original signal. Therefore, this article adopts a sampling frequency of 10 MHz. Thus, the IQ signal parsed by each PA is 6000 sample points. The parameter settings are shown in Table III. All the simulation experiments are completed in the CentOS 7.0 working environment, which can support Torch 1.12 and Python 3.9. The working environment is also equipped with four Nvidia RTX 2080Ti GPUs, which can get the simulation results more efficiently. In addition, MySQL database, MySQL

Workbench, and Neo4j are also used for the construction and visual representation of KG. In the SEI task, the parameter settings are shown in Table IV.
B. Feature Library and Knowledge Graph
In this article, we use MATLAB to extract features of the original RF signal according to the real part and the imaginary part, and splice the extracted features to get the signal feature of the input KG-AFC architecture as X ∈ R36000×56. Then import it into MySQL database to generate feature library and use MySQL Workbench to realize visualization. The visualization interface of MySQL Workbench is shown in Fig. 4. Based on the constructed feature library, the RF signal KG is constructed by artificially establishing the relationship between entities and attributes using prior expert knowledge, and the KG is visualized using Neo4j. For the convenience of viewing, select one of the data at random for Neo4j visual representation, as shown in Fig. 5.
C. Comparison of Different Compression Ratios
The proposed KG-AFC algorithm architecture has a certain flexibility due to the nonlinear interaction between learning channel features. At the same time, in this article, we consider different compression ratios to choose the best compression ratio to achieve a balance between performance and complexity. For the SEI task, the compression ratios we consider for comparison are r = {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}.
1) Performance of Different Compression Ratios: We select the compression ratio above for Monte Carlo simulation, and run 100 times for each compression ratio. Through Monte Carlo simulation results, the performance under different compression ratios is analyzed and discussed. Here, the detailed results of 100 Monte Carlo simulations are shown by box plot, which can be found in Fig. 6. The box plot cannot be affected by outliers, can accurately and stably depict the discrete distribution of data, and is also conducive to data cleaning. It can display the maximum, minimum, median, upper, and lower quartiles of a group of data. Among them, the black line in the middle of the box is the median, representing the average level of the data; the upper and lower limits of the box are the upper and lower quartiles of the data, which can reflect the fluctuation of the data to a certain extent; and black “o” represents the outlier and two black horizontal lines visually mean the maximum and minimum values in the case of removing outliers. In addition, to better reflect the changing process of
identification accuracy under different compression ratios r, we take the medium value when r = 2 as the baseline. From the box plot of identification accuracy for the KGAFC algorithm, we can find that when r = {8, 16, 32}, there are many discrete points in the result, and the result shows a certain randomness and is not stable. However, in the case of r = {2, 4}, the number of discrete points is small and the identification accuracy is relatively stable. Through further comparison with the original identification accuracy without compression, we find that within the range of r = {2, 4, 8}, the fluctuation amplitude of the data in the box is relatively small, and the data is relatively concentrated. This means that the identification performance fluctuates less, and it can be considered that the performance is robust within this range. In addition, according to the baseline, we compare the identification accuracy under different compression ratios r, and it is obvious that when r = {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}, with the increase of the compression ratio r, the average identification accuracy slowly decreases, but it is still within the acceptable range. 2) Complexity of Different Compression Ratios: We also consider the complexity of the KG-AFC algorithm under different compression ratios. The model complexity is divided into time complexity and space complexity. The time complexity determines the training and testing time of the model. The smaller the highest order of time complexity, the better the time performance of the algorithm. If the time complexity is too high, it will lead to an increase in the running time and space of the model, which is undoubtedly unfavorable for the rapid verification and prediction of the model. Generally, we consider that all input data are of equal probability, that is to say, calculate the average time complexity. We can use floating-point operations (FLOPs) to measure the time complexity of the model. Because the classification of the KG-AFC architecture is mainly realized by the convolution layer and the AFC strategy is realized by the convolution layer, this article mainly considers the time complexity of the convolution layer. The time complexity formula can be expressed as
TSingle ∼ O(SM × SK × Cin × Cout) (23)
where SM represents the output size of the single convolution layer; SK represents the size of the convolution kernel; and Cin and Cout represent the number of input and output channels of this layer, respectively. Hence, the time complexity of the whole neural network [11] can be expressed as
TAll ∼ O
( N ∑
l=1
SMl × SKl × Cl−1 × Cl
)
(24)
where N represents the depth of CNN. In addition, the space complexity determines the number of parameters of the neural network, we define it as
SpaceAll ∼ O
( N ∑
l=1
×SKl × Cl−1 × Cl
)
. (25)
According to the above formula, the illustration of the time and space complexity for KG-AFC is shown in Fig. 7. From the model complexity of each compression ratio, we observe

that with the increase of compression ratio, both time complexity and space complexity decrease. The simulation results are also in line with our original purpose of introducing the AFC block, that is, to effectively reduce the amount of computation and reduce the complexity of the model through FC. Combined with the simulation results of identification accuracy and computational complexity under different compression ratios, it is not difficult to see that the performance is robust for a certain range of compression ratios, but the computational complexity decreases significantly with the increase of compression ratios, especially in the case of uncompressed and r = 2. To sum up, we choose the compression ratio of r = 8 to achieve the maximum balance between
performance and complexity. The compression ratio can effectively reduce the computational complexity without reducing the identification accuracy.
D. Advantages of Performance and Overhead
To verify the advantages of the proposed KG-AFC method in terms of performance and computation overhead, we carry out some comparative experiments.
1) Comparative Experiments: The selected SEI methods include three ML-based methods and two-DL based methods. kNN: This is one of the simplest and most commonly used classification algorithms in ML, which measures the distance

between different feature values for classification. Here, let the value of k as 3.
OneVsRestClassifier (Gupta et al. [27]): This is an ML-based method, which is an improved version of SVM and can be applied in multiclassification scenarios. This method equips each label with a classifier. For each classifier, the classification will be fitted with other classifications. DMEL (Wang et al. [28]): This is an ML-based method. This method embeds features through nine complex convolutional layers and three FCs while utilizing metric learning to classify features. RVCNN (Wang et al. [5]): This is a DL-based method. This method consists of nine convolutional layers and three FCs, of which three FCs are its classifiers.
MSCNN (Zhang et al. [33]): This is a DL-based method. This method extracts features from three receptive fields through different convolution kernels and carries out feature fusion to make them complete SEI tasks through the classifier. The classifier selected by MSCNN is three FCs.
2) Performance Comparison: We compared the identification accuracy of these methods above, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 8. According to the simulation results of different SEI methods, we can conclude that the proposed KG-AFC has the best identification accuracy. In addition, this also indicates that the KG-AFC algorithm can effectively emphasize important features and ignore unimportant features during feature reconstruction to improve performance. 3) Overhead Comparison: We compared the computation overhead of these methods above, and the simulation results are shown in Table V. As is shown in Table V, the DL-based SEI methods often require longer training time than the ML-based SEI methods. While the ML-based DMEL, due to its direct processing of complex data, makes the calculation more complex, so the long training time is reasonable. Overall, the proposed KGAFC has significant advantages in training time, testing time, and total time compared to the cutting-edge DL-based SEI

methods, only inferior to the well-known kNN and improved SVM (OneVsRestClassifier) for their fast computation time. From the perspective of storage overhead, the proposed KGAFC outperforms all other SEI methods and even reduces storage overhead by 7–11 times compared to the same DLbased RVCNN and MSCNN. It can be seen that KG-AFC has considerable advantages in terms of storage overhead. It is worth noting that the storage overhead of the kNN is relatively high, as the kNN algorithm needs to save all training samples. Therefore, when the sample size is relatively large, the storage overhead will be high, so this result is reasonable. Combining identification accuracy and computation overhead, we can easily conclude that the proposed KG-AFC algorithm not only effectively improves identification accuracy but also exhibits advantages in computation overhead. It can achieve a good balance between performance and computation overhead. Meanwhile, the visualization assistance of KG enhances the model’s representation ability and further expands the application boundaries of KG.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, we proposed a novel SEI method using KG-AFC based on adaptive signal feature embedded KG. The proposed KG-AFC innovatively combined the relevant characteristic of KG, uses KG to visually represent the extracted features, and stores them. In addition, with the feature weight layer based on the attention mechanism, the proposed KG-AFC algorithm was able to obtain the best combination strategy automatically. The simulation results proved that the KG-AFC achieved the balance between identification accuracy and computation overhead through the comparison of different compression ratios and different SEI methods. With the help of KG, we can analyze the RF signal more accurately through the visualization of the signal features.
