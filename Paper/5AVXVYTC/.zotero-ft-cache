Abstract
Motivation: Identifying new uses of approved drugs is an effective way to reduce the time and cost of drug development. Recent computational approaches for predicting drug–disease associations have integrated multi-sourced data on drugs and diseases. However, neighboring topologies of various scales in multiple heterogeneous drug–disease networks have yet to be exploited and fully integrated. Results: We propose a novel method for drug–disease association prediction, called MGPred, used to encode and learn multiscale neighboring topologies of drug and disease nodes and pairwise attributes from heterogeneous networks. First, we constructed three heterogeneous networks based on multiple kinds of drug similarities. Each network comprises drug and disease nodes and edges created based on node-wise similarities and associations that ref lect specific topological structures. We also propose an embedding mechanism to formulate topologies that cover different ranges of neighbors. To encode the embeddings and derive multi-scale neighboring topology representations of drug and disease nodes, we propose a module based on graph convolutional autoencoders with shared parameters for each heterogeneous network. We also propose scalelevel attention to obtain an adaptive fusion of informative topological representations at different scales. Finally, a learning module based on a convolutional neural network with various receptive fields is proposed to learn multi-view attribute representations of a pair of drug and disease nodes. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that MGPred outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in comparison to drug-related disease prediction, and the recall rates for the topranked candidates and case studies on five drugs further demonstrate the ability of MGPred to retrieve potential drug–disease associations.
Introduction
The development of a novel drug typically takes 10 to 15 years and 0.8 to 1.5 billion dollars to complete [1–5]. In addition, the likelihood of a new drug being successfully approved by a regulatory agency is usually less than 10% [6]. It is therefore important to discover new uses of approved drugs, namely drug repositioning [7, 8]. The tolerability and pharmacological characteristics of approved drugs have been clarified, and these drugs can be used more effectively and safely in clinics. More importantly, the time and economic cost of drug repositioning are much less than that of new drug R&D from scratch, which may shorten the drug R&D cycle to 6.5 years and reduce the expense to $300 million [9–11].
By predicting the probability of association between approved drugs and diseases, we screened reliable candidate diseases, which was conducive to further experimental verification. Previously, there were three classes of approaches used to study drug–disease associations. The first class only integrates similar and associative data between drugs and diseases for predicting the association. A support vector machine based classifier was employed to evaluate the associative probability by integrating data on drugs and diseases [12]. Methods of similarity constrained matrix factorization [13] and nonnegative matrix factorization [14] were utilized to integrate drug characteristics, the semantic similarities of diseases and known drug–disease associations.

presented a novel algorithm, called PREDICT, to infer novel drug indications. A few approaches have utilized random walk or bi-random walk on the established bilayer network for predictive purposes [16–18]. However, the above methods only use the drug and disease similarities and associative information, ignoring the side effects and target information of the drug. The second class of approaches took advantage of multi-source data for an associative prediction. A threelayer heterogeneous network model (TL-HGBI) [19] was proposed to conduct drug repositioning using the target information integrated by a heterogeneous network. Liang et al. [20] integrated information on multiple attributes of drugs and employed a sparse subspace learning approach to predict the associations. Nonnegative matrix factorization [21], inference probability matrix factorization [22] and graph regularization matrix factorization [23] were used to discover novel effects for existing drugs. Several approaches had been employed to conduct associative predictions using a random walk on the constructed network [24–27]. Nevertheless, the above approaches are all based on shallow models, and it is difficult to capture the complex nonlinear relationship among multi-sourced data. The third class of methods was based on a deep learning approach to deeply integrate various drug and disease data and improve the prediction performance. A few approaches have applied convolutional neural network (CNN) to drug repositioning [28–30]. A Gaussian kernel autoencoder had been used to screen the candidates [31]. A model based on the combination of a CNN and BiLSTM was established for associative predictions [32]. Several methods used GCN [33–35], GNN [36] and sparse autoencoder deep neural network [37] to learn the lowdimensional features of drugs and diseases to evaluate the association scores. However, these approaches neglect the multi-scale neighboring topologies of the nodes and the multi-view attribute information of multiple heterogeneous networks. We presented a novel predictive model, MGPred, which integrated and learned pairwise attributes and multi-scale neighboring topologies of drugs and diseases nodes. The contribution points are summarized as follows.
• To associate various types of drug similarities, we establish three drug–disease bi-layer networks. Based on these three networks, the topological representations of drug and disease nodes are learned separately for extracting the specific topology of each network. • We propose a learning module based on multiple graph convolutional autoencoders with parameter sharing to enhance the integration of various similarities and associations of drugs and diseases from multiple views. This module contains a new multiscale embedding mechanism to generate a multiscale neighboring topology embedding.
• Since neighboring topologies at different scales have different contributions to drug–disease association prediction, we design a scale-level attention mechanism to distinguish their contributions and obtain multi-scale neighboring topology encoding for each drug–disease network. • A CNN encoding module with multiple receptive fields is proposed to encode the attribute representations of drug–disease node pairs. The attributes of node pairs in different ranges are adaptively integrated using learnable and adjustable sizes of the receptive field. The improvement in the MGPred performance is demonstrated through a comparison with six advanced predictive models, the recall rates in top-ranked candidates and case studies of five drugs.
Materials and Methods
We present MGPred for predicting candidate diseases associated with a given drug. Three drug–disease bilayer networks are created by taking advantage of multisourced data on drugs and diseases (Figure 1). MGPred consists of two modules, as shown in Figure 2. In the first module, the multi-scale neighboring topological representations of the drug and disease nodes are learned using multiple graph convolutional autoencoders with parameter sharing. For this module, we also design a novel scale-level attention mechanism to integrate the multi-scale neighboring topological representations of drug and disease nodes. Afterward, a module based on CNN with different receptive fields is constructed which is used to encode the low-dimensional attribute representations of drug–disease node pairs. Finally, the multiscale neighboring topological representation and the attribute representation of the node pair are passed through the fully connected layer and combined to form the final drug–disease association score. We also demonstrate the schematic diagram and algorithm of MGPred in Supplementary Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.
Dataset
From previous research, information related to drugdisease association, the chemical substructures of drugs, the structural domains and gene ontology annotations of drug target proteins and the semantic similarities of diseases were acquired [20]. At the same time, we acquired 3051 known associations between 763 drugs and 608 diseases from the Unified Medical Language System(UMLS) [38, 39]. The chemical fingerprints were acquired from PubChem, and this information was employed to build drug-related chemical substructure profiles [40]. PubChem is a database of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The domain and gene ontology annotation information of drug target proteins were acquired from the InterPro and UniProt databases,

respectively [41, 42]. The semantic similarity of diseases was computed by constructing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of diseases, which was proposed by Wang et al. [43]. The disease terms for constructing the DAGs were taken from the U.S. National Library of Medicine(ULM).
Multi-source data representation Representation of drug similarities
Based on multiple types of drug-related data, we acquire three kinds of drug similarity matrices (Figure 1A). This is expressed as follows:
Hv
r = { Hrchem, Hdoma
r , Hanno
r
} , (1)
where v = (chem, doma, anno), the chemical substructure similarity matrix of the drug, Hrchem, is obtained based on the biological premise that the more chemical substructures that ri and rj have in common, the more similar their functions will be. Hrchem is calculated by utilizing the chemical substructure information and cosine similarity measure. In addition, Hrchem ∈ RNr×Nr , where Nr denotes the number of drugs, i.e. 763. When ri and rj have more common target protein domains or more gene ontology annotations, the similarity between ri and rj will increase [44, 45]. Based on these premises, the domain similarity of the drug target proteins Hdoma
r ∈ RNr×Nr and the functional annotation similarity of the targets Hanno
r ∈ RNr×Nr are also calculated using the cosine similarity measure. The values of Hrchem, Hdoma
r and Hanno
r are within [0, 1]. The larger the value is, the more similar ri and rj.
Representation of disease similarities
Diseases are usually expressed by DAGs containing their related terms. Utilizing their DAGs, the semantic similarity between two diseases is computed, the method for which is presented by Wang et al [46]. The similarity between Nd diseases from the matrix Hd ∈ RNd×Nd (Figure 1B) and Nd indicates the number of diseases, i.e. 681. Hd
i,j ∈ [0, 1], and the higher the value, the higher the semantic similarity between di and dj.
Representation of drug–disease associations
Brd ∈ RNr×Nd is the drug–disease association matrix, which records the relationship between Nr drugs and Nd diseases. If ri is associated with dj, then Brd
i,j is 1; otherwise, it is 0.
Multiple drug–disease heterogeneous networks Facing three different drug similarities, three drugdisease heterogeneous networks Gv(v = chem, doma, anno) are constructed (Figure 1D). Each heterogeneous network
contains two types of nodes F = {FR ∪ FD} and three
types of edges E = {EvRR ∪ EDD ∪ ERD}. EvRR is the edge of the drug–drug similarity, which is built based on the vth drug similarity. In addition, EDD represents the edge between disease and disease, which is constructed using the semantic similarity of the disease. Taking advantage of the known association data, the drugdisease side is established, which is represented using ERD. If a connection is observed between nodes fi ∈ F and fj ∈ F, then eij ∈ E.

Adjacency matrices of multiple drug–disease bi-layer networks
Suppose that the adjacency matrix of the vth bi-layer network is expressed as
Av =

where Av ∈ RNq×Nq (Nq = Nr +Nd) and BrdT is the transposition of Brd. In addition, (v = chem, doma, anno) represented the drug similarity calculated based on different angles.
Multi-scale neighbor topologies and attributes extraction based on embedding strategy Extraction of multi-scale neighboring topological embeddings
The direct neighbor node for each ri(dj) node in the vth bilayer network is its first-order neighboring topology, and
its k-order neighboring topology is formed after k hops from that node. The first-order neighboring topology and k-order neighboring topology reflect the neighboring topology of the node at different scales, and neighboring topologies at different scales are extremely important for predicting drug–disease associations. Therefore, to study the low-dimensional topological representations of all nodes at different scales, we establish a framework based on multiple graph convolutional autoencoders with shared parameters. The first-order neighboring topology embedding of the vth bi-layer network is ˆAv1 (Figure 3),
ˆAv
1 = (Dv)− 12 Av(Dv)− 21 , (3)
where (Dv)ii = ∑
j (Av)ij ∈ RNq×Nq and Dv is the degree matrix of Av and is also a diagonal matrix. In addition,

Figure 3. Calculation of kth-order neighbor topology of the vth network
Av = Av + I is considered first-order neighboring topological embedding after joining the self-connections, and I denote the identity matrix. The kth-order neighboring topological embedding of the vth network is generated as follows:
ˆAv
k = (Dv)− 12 Av[(Dv)−1Av]k -1(Dv)− 12 . (4)
Similarly, we added a self-connection to Av and ˆAv
k incorporates the topology information of k-hop neighboring nodes.
Extraction of node attribute embeddings Av
i records the similarity between ri and Nr drugs, and the association between Nd diseases, which can be treated as the attribute vector of ri. Likewise, ANr+j can be viewed as the attribute vector of dj. Thus, Av can be regarded as the attribute matrix of the vth network. We name the attribute matrix of the vth network as Zv and Zv = Av. We build different graph convolutional autoencoders with shared parameters for the three networks Gchem, Gdoma and Ganno, respectively.
Multi-scale neighbor topological encoding and decoding by graph convolutional autoencoder
Each network has neighboring topological embeddings of different scales ˆAv1, ˆAv2...Aˆ v
k... ˆAv
Nc and the corresponding
attribute matrix Zv. Nc is the number of all scales. We set up special graph convolution autoencoders with shared parameters to encode and learn the low-dimensional topological representations of the drugs (diseases) at the kth scale. Because the encoding and decoding processes of the three networks are similar, we only take the vth network as an example to introduce the encoding and decoding processes.
Encoding of the kth-scale neighboring topology. The encoder is composed of two layers of graph convolution. Given kth-scale neighboring topological embedding ˆAv
k
and attribute matrix Zv, the output feature maps of the first and -th layers of the graph convolutional encoder are denoted as

where LEN denotes the total number of encoding layers
and φ is a nonlinear activation function ReLU. We employ
W(1)
en and W( )
en to denote the weight matrices of the first and -th layers of the graph convolution encoder, respectively. In addition, Zv(1)
en and Zv( )
en are the corresponding encoding outputs of the first layer and the -th layer. Each line denotes the feature vector of ri(dj) node after a dimensionality reduction using the graph convolution encoder. The output of the last layer of the encoder is denoted as Zv(LEN)
en , which contains the low-dimensional topological representations of all drug and disease nodes. Let us rename it as Zv
k.
Decoding of the kth-scale neighboring topology. We utilize the decoder to upgrade the feature of the encoder back to the original dimension, and then compute the loss between the reconstructed matrices ˆZv
k and the orig
inal matrices Zv to obtain a better encoding for drugdisease association prediction. The decoder consists of two layers of graph convolution. Zv
k and ˆAv
k are utilized as inputs to the graph convolutional decoder. The decoding

of the last decoding layer is acquired and renamed as ˆZv
k. Optimization. We have three drug–disease networks, i.e. Gchem, Gdoma and Ganno, and each network has Nc scale neighboring topologies. Because the process of calculating the loss of the three networks is similar, we calculate the loss of Gchem as an example to describe this process. The loss of Gchem, Losschem, is
Losschem =
N ∑c
k=1
∥∥∥Zchem − ˆZchem
k
∥∥∥2
F, (9)
where Nc denotes the total number of scales and F represents the Frobenius norm. Similarly, the losses of Gdoma and Ganno are as follows:
Lossdoma =

F, (10)
Lossanno =

The final loss of the graph convolutional encoding module is
Lossc = Losschem + Lossdoma + Lossanno. (12)
Adam algorithm was utilized to optimize the loss function, and the graph convolution autoencoder was trained using the backpropagation algorithm.
Scale-level attention mechanism
We have learned the low-dimensional topological representations of ri(dj) containing k-scale neighboring topologies in different heterogeneous networks and denote it as Zv
k. Let Zv
k (ri) and Zv
kdj) be the low-dimensional topological representations of ri and dj after a dimensionality reduction through graph convolution. Because the encoding of ri(dj) of different scales has different contributions to the
final prediction, a new scale-level attention mechanism is presented to obtain the topological representations of attention-enhanced ri(dj). Because the scale attention mechanism of ri and dj is similar, we take ri as an example to describe the mechanism. In the vth network, the attention score of the kth-scale level of ri is sv
k,
sv
k = tsca tanh(WscaZv
k(ri) + bsca), (13)
where k = 1, 2...Nc represents the size of the scale. In addition, Wsca is the weight matrix. The weight and bias vectors are represented by tsca and bsca, respectively. The normalized attention weight is βv
ri ,k :
βv
ri,k = exp(sv
k)
∑
j∈Nc exp(sv
j ) , (14)
where exp is an exponential function and the value of βv
ri ,k
is within the range of [0,1]. The topology of ri enhanced
through the scale attention is expressed as  ̃Zv
k (ri ),
 ̃Zv
k(ri) = ∑
k∈Nc (βv
ri,k Zv
k(ri) + Zv
k(ri)), (15)
where  ̃Zv
k(ri) represents the enhanced topological representation of ri based on the kth-scale neighboring topology learning in the vth network. Based on the kth-scale neighboring topologies ˆAv
k and attribute matrices Zv of three different networks, three enhanced ri topological
representations, i.e.  ̃Zchem
k (ri),  ̃Zdoma
k (ri) and  ̃Zanno
k (ri) are
learned, respectively. To take full advantage of  ̃Zchem
k (ri),
 ̃Zdoma
k (ri) and  ̃Zanno
k (ri), we stack the attention-enhanced representations of ri up and down and then use 1 × 1 convolution to fuse them. The final topological representation of ri,  ̃Zv
ri,k, is defined as follows:
 ̃Zv
ri,k = conv(  ̃Zchem
k (ri)||  ̃Zdoma
k (ri)||  ̃Zanno
k (ri)), (16)
where conv represents 1 × 1 convolution operation and || represents the up and down stacking operation. The final topological representation Ztopo is acquired.
Drug–disease pairwise attribute extraction based on embedding strategy
If ri and dj are similar or related to more common drugs and diseases, they are more likely to be related. Based on this biological premise, an embedding strategy was presented to integrate the similarity and association of ri-dj and acquire the attribute embedding matrix of the node pairs. Given three kinds of drug similarity matrices Hrchem,
Hdoma
r and Hanno
r ; disease similarity matrix Hd; and drugdisease association matrix Brd, the attribute embedding matrix T of ri − dj was constructed (Figure 2C). First, facing drug similarity at the chemical substructure level, to embed the connections from the common drug, we stack the i-th row of Hrchem, (Hrchem)i,∗, up and down with

the transpose of the j-th column of Brd, Br d T
∗,j , which is expressed as follows:
t1 =
[
(Hchem
r )i,∗; Brd
∗,j
T]
, (17)
where (Hrchem)i,∗ contains similarities at the chemical substructure level between ri and Nr drugs, and ; indicates
the up-down stack operation. In addition, BrdT
∗,j records the association between dj and all drugs. Similarly, embeddings based on the domain level and annotation level of the drug target protein are obtained as
t2 =
[
(Hdoma
r )i,∗; Brd
∗,j
T]
; (18)
t3 =
[
(Hanno

T]
. (19)
Among them, (Hdoma
r )i,∗ and (Hanno
r )i,∗ cover the similarity between ri and all drugs at the level of the domain and the annotation, respectively. Finally, the association of common diseases is captured by splicing up and down the i-th row of Brd, Brd
i,∗ and the j-th row of Hd, Hd
∗,j, as follows:
t4 =
[
Brd
i,∗; Hd

, (20)
where Hd
∗,j covers the semantic similarity between dj and all diseases. Finally, the attribute embedding matrix T ∈ R2×Ng of ri-dj is constructed, and Ng = 3Nr + Nd.

Paired attribute encoding based on CNN
Given the attribute embedding matrix of ri-dj, CNN with multiple receptive fields are applied to learn the attribute representation of ri-dj. To capture the marginal information of the attribute embedding matrix T, we conduct a
zero-padded operation on T. Set Fφ ∈ Rnφw×nφ
h ×nconv as the
filter, where φ = (1, 2, 3) denotes filters of different scales, and nφ
h and nφ
w are the length and height of the filter, respectively. In addition, nconv represents the number of filters used. When the m-th filter Fφ
m slides to the Ti,j position,
Tφ
m,i,j = T(i : i + nφ
w, j : j + nφ
h), (22)
where i ∈ [1, 4−nφ
w + 1], j ∈ [1, 2 + ng − nφ
h + 1], m ∈
[1, nconv] and ng = 3Nr + Nd. The filter Fφ
m,i,j of the φth scale
slides on Tφ
i,j to obtain the element value Cφ
m(i, j) at the mth feature map Cφ
m as
Cφ
m(i, j) = σ (Fφ
m,i,j ∗Tφ
m,i,j + b(m)), (23)
where b is the bias term and Cφ
m(i, j) is the element value of the i-th row and j-th column in the m-th feature map. Moreover, σ is ReLU activation function. Max-pooling can be used to select the most important attributes in Cφ
m. We utilize na and nb to denote the length and height of the filter in the pooling layer, respectively. The i-th row and j-th column in the m-th feature map are represented by Pm,i,j, which is calculated as follows:
Pm,i,j = max(Cφ
m(i : i + nb, j : j + na)). (24)
Given that the filter sizes of the three scales are n1w × n1
h = 2 × 2, n2w × n2
h = 2 × 3 and n3w × n3
h = 3 × 3, and that the corresponding outputs are T(1) ,T(2) and T(3) , we further use max-pooling and acquire Tˆ (1) , Tˆ (2) and Tˆ (3) . We then splice them at the left and right to form TL. TL is sent to the second convolutional layer and the pooling layer for fusion, and finally acquire deeply integrated attribute representation Tˆ of ri-dj.
Final integration and optimization
We f latten the given topological representation Ztopo into vector ˆztopo and send it to the fully connected layer and the softmax layer to learn the association score of ri-dj. The association score, qtopo, is defined as follows:
qtopo = soft max(Wtopo ˆztopo + btopo), (25)
where Wtopo is the weight matrix and btopo is the bias vector. In addition, qtopo =
[
qtopo
0 , qtopo
1
]
, where qtopo
1 and qtopo
0
record the probability that ri-dj is related and unrelated, respectively. The cross-entropy loss function between the drug and disease associative prediction score qtopo and the true label is defined as
Lossgcn = −
N ∑t
i=1
[yl × log (qtopo)1 + (1 − yl) × log(1 − (qtopo)0)],
(26)
where Nt represents a set of training samples and yl represents the true label. It is known that yl = 1 when the ri is associated with the dj, and yl = 0 when there is no such association. Given that the attribute of ri-dj represents Tˆ , it is f lattened into a vector tˆ. Then tˆ is fed into the full connection and softmax layers. The predicted correlation score qattr and the cross-entropy loss of another module are

calculated as follows:
qattr = soft max(Wattrˆt + battr); (27)
Losscnn = −
N ∑t
i=1
[yl × log (qattr)1 + (1 − yl) × log(1 − (qattr)0)],
(28)
where (qattr)1 and (qattr)0 represent the ri-dj related probability and the non-related probability, respectively. We use the Adam algorithm and backpropagation algorithm to optimize and update Lossgcn and Losscnn. Finally, qtopo and qattr are weighted and integrated to obtain the final predicted score Y:
Y = λ × qtopo + (1 − λ)qattr, (29)
where λ ∈ [0, 1], and λ is the regulation parameter balancing the contributions of qtopo and qattr.
Experiment results and discussions Experiment setup and evaluation metrics
For the multi-scale neighboring topology encoding module, the layers of the graph convolution encoding and decoding and the scale of the neighboring topology are both set to 2. The output feature dimensions of the two graph convolutional encoding layers are 1000 and 700, and the output dimensions of the decoding layers are 1000 and 1444, respectively. The filter sizes of the first convolution layer of the attribute encoding module are 2×2, 2×3 and 3×3, respectively. The sizes of the second convolution layer and pooling layer are both 2×2. In the first and second convolutional layers, we use 16 and 32 filters, respectively. MGPred and other approaches used to infer drugrelated diseases are evaluated using 5-fold crossvalidation. Known drug–disease associations and undiscovered associations are treated as positive and negative samples, respectively. First, we randomly divide positive examples into five parts. In each fold cross-validation, four positive samples and the same number of negative samples are randomly selected as the training set. The remaining positive and negative samples are used as the test sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precisionrecall curve (AUPRC) and the top k recall rates are used as evaluation indicators. Because biologists are more willing to select the top-ranked candidates for further experimental verification, we also calculated the recall rate of top k ∈ [30, 240]. The higher the value, the more correct samples are identified.

the association prediction. These similarities include the drug chemical substructure similarity (DCS), the drug target domain similarity (DDS) and the drug target annotation similarity (DAS). As shown in Table 1, the whole model of MGPred got the best prediction performance when it utilized all these drug similarities. When MGPred was trained without DCS, its AUROC and AUPRC are reduced by 3.3% and 6.2%, respectively. When there is no DDS for training, AUROC and AUPRC decreased by 1.1% and 3.2%, respectively. When DAS was removed from the training process, AUROC and AUPRC dropped down by 2.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The experimental results indicated DCS has the most contribution to the increased prediction performance. It might be because there is more complete information of chemical structures of drugs, while there are less known targets for each drug.
Comparison with other methods
To evaluate the performance of MGPred, we compare it with six advanced approaches: GFPred [34], CBPred [32], SCMFDD [13], LRSSL [20], MBiRW [18] and HGBI [19]. To make the comparison results more convincing, MGPred and all comparison methods use the same dataset for the training and testing, and each comparison method uses the optimal parameter settings provided in the corresponding literature. We also briefly describe these six methods as follows. HGBI[19]: HGBI constructed a triple-layer network composed of the drug, disease and target nodes, and the similarity or interaction connections among them. It evaluated the association score between a pair of drug and disease nodes based on information flowing in the network. MBiRW[18]: MBiRW built a drug–disease heterogeneous network by utilizing the drug similarities, the disease similarities and the associations between drugs and diseases. It inferred the potential drug–disease associations by bi-directional random walk on the network. LRSSL[20]: LRSSL integrated the chemical substructures of drugs, the domains of drug targets and the functional annotations of targets. It presented a method based on sparse subspace learning to predict the new indications for drugs. SCMFDD[13]: SCMFDD proposed a matrix factorization approach with similarity constraint for improving the performance of predicting candidate drug–disease associations. CBPred[32]: CBPred focused on the drug similarities based on their chemical structures, the disease

similarity and the observed drug–disease associations. It proposed a method based on CNN and bi-directional long short-term memory network to estimate the drugdisease association scores. GFPred[34]: GFPred utilized multiple kinds of drug similarities, and it constructed a prediction model based on graph convolutional auto-encoders. We provide the average ROC and PR curves obtained for all drugs using various approaches (Figure 4). Our approach achieves the highest average AUROC (0.984), which is 3.9% higher than the second-ranked GFPred; 5.8% higher than CBpred, 15.3% and 15.6% better than LRSSL and MBiRW, respectively; 26.1% higher than SCMFDD; and 28.2% higher than the last ranked HGBI. As biologists are more willing to validate top-ranked candidate drugs, we show the partial ROC and partial AUC of FPR 0.1 (Supplementary Figure 3). The AUPRC value of MGPred is the best (0.434), and is 19.1%, 27.1%, 32.7%, 38.9%, 42.1% and 42.2% higher than those of GFPred, CBpred, LRSSL, MBiRW, SCMFDD and HGBI, respectively. The paired Wilcoxon test is also employed as an indicator to verify the performance of MGPred. It can be seen from Table 2 that MGPred is significantly better than the other comparison methods (p-value < 0.05). From the results, GFPred ranked second, taking advantage of the similarity of multiple types of drugs and learning the topological representations of drug (disease)
nodes in different networks. This shows that the use of information from multiple heterogeneous networks contributes to improved performance. CBpred ranked third, considering the path information of the node pairs. Although the AUROC value of LRSSL is slightly better than that of MBiRW, the AUPRC value is significantly lower than that of MBiRW. One possible reason may be that the former takes advantage of different drug similarities, whereas the latter considers only a type of similarity. SCMFDD and HGBI are based on non-negative matrix factorization and information flow, respectively. Their AUROC and AUPRC values are similar, but their performance was poor. It may be that they do not consider multiple kinds of drug similarities and various bilayer networks. The improvement in the MGPred performance is mainly due to the use of multiple types of drug similarity used to establish multiple bi-layer networks. In addition, we deeply learn the multiscale neighboring topologies of various networks and the attributes of ri-dj node pairs. From Figure 5, we can see the recall rate for under different top-k values. Because we have learned multiscale neighboring topologies and node pair attributes, our model is significantly better than the other six models under different top-k values. When k = 30, MGPred exhibited the highest recall rate (83.6%). GFPred is second, at 75.2%. CBPred ranked third, at 68.8%. When the

top-k values range from 60 to 120, our model still has the highest recall rate, which is 88.9%, 93.9% and 95.4%, respectively, and GFPred ranks second, with recall rates of 80.79%, 85.2% and 88.6%, respectively. CBPred was slightly higher than LRSSL, and the corresponding recall rates of CBPred were 72.6%, 76.4% and 79.9%, whereas the recall rates of LRSSL are 70.6%, 74.9% and 77.4%, respectively. Within the top-k values range of 30 to 120, the recall rates of MBiRW are 62.1%, 70.6%, 74.89% and 77.4%, and the recall rates of SCMFDD are 27.9%, 41.7%, 50.7% and 55.8%, respectively. HGBI have the lowest recall rates of 25.6%, 37.3%, 45.6% and 51.6%, respectively.
Case studies on five drugs
To prove the capacity of MGPred to predict drug–disease associations, we carry out a case study of five drugs: ampicillin, acetaminophen, etoposide, clonidine and sertraline. The predicted association scores between each drug and the candidate diseases are ranked in descending order. We also collect the top-10 candidate diseases associated with each drug for analysis. The results are shown in Table 3. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) contains important information on the drugs and their effects on human diseases, hand-curated from the published literature [47]. DrugBank covers the clinical data and attributes information of the drugs [48]. In Table 3, 37 candidates were recorded in the CTD and six are contained in the DrugBank database, which shows that these candidate diseases are more likely to be associated with the corresponding drugs. The largest clinical trial database, ClinicalTrials.gov, is operated by NLM. It contains information regarding
on medical studies on human volunteers. PubChem is supported by the NIH and includes the chemical structures of small organic molecules and information regarding their biological activities. A total of 31 candidates are recorded in ClinicalTrials.gov. This suggests that the corresponding drug–disease association is supported by clinical trials. A total of 16 candidates are covered by PubChem [49]. It indicates there is a higher possibility that these drugs are associated with the corresponding diseases. Two candidate diseases are labeled ‘literature’ demonstrating that the effect of the corresponding drug on the disease is supported in the literature. Hand-collated drug–disease associations and potential associations inferred from the literature are covered in the CTD. Two candidates (postoperative complications and pseudomonas infections) are supported in the CTD literature, indicating that they are more likely to be related to the corresponding drugs. Among the 50 total associations, one association is not confirmed and is labeled as ‘unconfirmed’. In summary, the case studies of five drugs further prove that MGPred has the ability to discover drug-related diseases.

topologies to predict disease-related drugs. A framework based on multiple graph convolutional autoencoders and multi-receptive field CNNs was established to learn the multi-scale neighboring topologies and node-pair-level attributes of drugs and diseases. The scale attention mechanism was proposed to assign more weight to the features of more important scales. The AUC and AUPR of MGPred are consistently higher than those of other drug–disease association prediction methods. The top-k candidates for MGPred have more realistic drug–disease associations. Comparisons with the latest six methods and five drug case studies demonstrate the powerful capacity of MGPred to identify potential drug-related diseases.
Key Points
• Three drug–disease bi-layer networks were built, which helped to extract the drug similarity, disease similarity and their associations from multi-sourced data. These networks were also conducive to further learning the topological representations of drugs and diseases from different perspectives. • A new framework based on multiple graph convolutional autoencoders and CNN with multiple receptive fields was built to encode and integrate the two-level representations of drugs and diseases. Neighboring topological representations revealed multi-scale neighbor topologies of drugs and diseases in different heterogeneous networks, and node pair attribute representations revealed

the deep connection between drugs and diseases that were co-associated by ri-dj. • Neighboring topologies of different scales contribute differently to the prediction of predicting drug-related diseases. We proposed scale-level attention to distinguish their contributions. • The improvement in the predictive performance of MGPred was confirmed through a comparison with six advanced methods, the recall rates in top-ranked candidates and case studies of five drugs.
