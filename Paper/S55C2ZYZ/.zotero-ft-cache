Abstract— Dysregulation of miRNAs is closely related to the progression of various diseases, so identifying diseaserelated miRNAs is crucial. Most recently proposed methods are based on graph reasoning, while they did not completely exploit the topological structure composed of the higher-order neighbor nodes and the global and local features of miRNA and disease nodes. We proposed a prediction method, MDAP, to learn semantic features of miRNA and disease nodes based on various meta-paths, as well as node features from the entire heterogeneous network perspective, and node pair attributes. Firstly, for both the miRNA and disease nodes, node category-wise meta-paths were constructed to integrate the similarity and association connection relationships. Each target node has its specific neighbor nodes for each meta-path, and the neighbors of longer meta-paths constitute its higherorder neighbor topological structure. Secondly, we constructed a meta-path specific graph convolutional network module to integrate the features of higher-order neighbors and their topology, and then learned the semantic representations of nodes. Thirdly, for the entire miRNAdisease heterogeneous network, a global-aware graph convolutional autoencoder was built to learn the networkview feature representations of nodes. We also designed semantic-level and representation-level attentions to obtain informative semantic features and node representations. Finally, the strategy based on the parallel convolutionaldeconvolutional neural networks were designed to enhance the local feature learning for a pair of miRNA and disease nodes. The experiment results showed that MDAP outperformed other state-of-the-art methods, and the ablation experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of MDAP’s major innovations.

I. INTRODUCTION
M
ICRORNAS (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with a length of 22–24 nucleotides [1], [2]. Abnormalities in miRNAs have been associated with the development of various diseases [3], [4]. For this reason, identifying diseaseassociated miRNAs can help explore the pathogenesis of diseases and facilitate their diagnosis and treatment. Calculating the likelihood of predicting miRNAs associated with diseases can assist in the selection of candidate miRNAs for each disease, reducing the cost and time required for biological experiments. The three major categories of existing miRNA-disease association prediction methods are as follows. The biological premise underlying the first group of methods is that miRNAs are more likely to be associated with comparable diseases when their functions are similar [5]. Thus, the functional similarity of miRNAs is determined using the diseases related to the two miRNAs [6]. Xuan et al. [7] utilized the miRNA family and cluster information to measure the miRNA similarities and identified the potential disease-related miRNAs by the top k most similar neighbors. The prediction models based on random walk on the similarity networks were constructed [8], [9]. However, it was difficult for them to predict the candidate miRNAs for the new diseases. The strategies in the secondary category add extra diseases information to establish miRNA-disease heterogeneous networks to incorporate miRNA-disease association, miRNA similarity and disease similarity. To infer disease-associated candidate miRNAs, Chen et al. proposed an association score estimation strategy based on k-nearest neighbors [10], and You et al. proposed a depth-first search method [11]. Wang et al. introduced miRNA sequence information into their model and used a logic tree classifier for miRNA-disease association prediction [12]. Certain matrix decomposition-based techniques are also available [13]–[17]. However, the methods mentioned


2 IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2023
above did not fully integrate the context relationships among the various connections in the miRNA-disease heterogeneous network. The miRNA-disease association score can also be obtained using random walk [18]–[21], regularized least squares [22], miRNA-disease network projection [23], [24] and label propagation [25]. These methods built the shallow prediction models and they failed to learn the deep and representative features of the miRNA and disease nodes. The third category uses deep learning techniques to combine data on miRNAs and diseases to more precisely identify potential miRNA candidates linked to diseases. Convolutional neural network (CNN) based prediction models were proposed by Peng et al. [26] and Xuan et al. [27]. These models did not completely take advantage of the more local and detailed features in the feature map of a pair of miRNA and disease nodes. In addition, graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) [28]–[30], generative adversarial networks [31], fully connected autoencoder [32], variational graph autoencoder [33], and deep belief networks [34] have been used to model miRNA-disease association candidate prediction. These prediction models achieved decent prediction performances as they learned the deep and representative features of the miRNA and disease nodes. However, they rarely focused on integrating the meta-path semantic information which is specific to each type of nodes, and learning the global context relationships within the miRNA-disease network. We suggest a novel prediction method in this study called MDAP for learning meta-path semantics of multiple types of nodes and higher-order structures in a miRNA-disease heterogeneous network. The method leverages topological information of the entire network and diverse node-pair attribute information. The following is a summary of our model’s contributions. • A heterogeneous network is firstly constructed and it consists of the miRNA and disease nodes, and the similarity connections and the association ones among them. There are long-distance dependencies among the nodes in the miRNA-disease network. Thus, we build multiple metapaths to form the topological structures composed of high-order neighbors and learn the dependencies among these neighbors. • The heterogenous network contains the miRNA nodes and the disease ones, and each type of nodes has their own meta-paths. The multiple meta-paths for the miRNA nodes and the ones for the disease nodes are established respectively, and these meta-paths reflect the biological characteristics that the miRNAs are more likely to associate with the diseases. A meta-path-sensitive learning module is constructed based on graph convolutional networks, and it may learn the semantic features of each miRNA (disease) node for each meta-path. Since the multiple meta-paths of the miRNA (disease) nodes have different contributions to the semantic feature learning, the semantic-level attention is designed to discriminate their contributions. • The entire heterogeneous network contains the various similarity and association connections and these connections have global context relationships. We constructed
a global-sensitive graph convolutional autoencoder to encode these relationships and form the network-view representations of the miRNA and disease nodes. Furthermore, the attention at the representation level is proposed to adaptively fuse the semantic representations and the network-view representations of multiple types of nodes. • The detailed features from the local regions of the feature map of a pair of miRNA-disease nodes are important auxiliary information for miRNA-disease association prediction. A module based on convolution and deconvolution networks is constructed to stretch the original feature map and learn the more local and detailed pairwise features. A comprehensive comparison with several recent prediction methods and the case studies over 3 diseases indicate our method’s superior performance and its ability in retrieving the potential disease-related miRNAs.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
We proposed an association prediction model, MDAP, to predict potential miRNAs linked to a certain disease (Figure 1). First, we learned semantic information about the metapaths specific to miRNA- and disease-type nodes, as well as the higher-order structure of the heterogeneous network based on meta-path-specific graph convolution (GCN) (Figure 1(a)). A global-aware graph convolutional autoencoder was constructed to integrate the global context relationships of all the nodes in the entire heterogeneous network (Figure 1(b)). A node representation-level attention mechanism was designed to self-adapt to fuse meta-path semantic representations and network-view representations (Figure 1(c)). In addition, we designed a parallel convolution and deconvolution network to encode the attributes of a pair of miRNA and disease nodes (Figure 1(d)).
A. Dataset
The Human MicroRNA Disease Database contains 7908 miRNA-disease correlations [35], and these associations cover 793 miRNAs and 341 diseases. We created directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using the terminology for diseases from the American Library of Medicine [36]. Based on their DAGs, the semantic similarity between the two diseases was determined [6].
B. Double-layer heterogeneous network and matrix
Definition 1. MiRNA-disease heterogeneous network. A miRNA-disease heterogeneous network is defined as G= (V, E, W ). The set of nodes V = V mir ∪ V dis , where V mir denotes Nm miRNA nodes {mir1, mir2, ..., mirNm } and V dis denotes Nd disease nodes {dis1, dis2, ..., disNd }. Edge eij ∈ E with weight wij ∈ W links a pair of nodes, vi, vj ∈ V . There is a node mapping function δ : V → θ and an edge mapping function ∆ : E → π. θ and π represents the node types and the edge types, and |θ| + |π| > 2. There are two kinds of connections between nodes in G. One is the intra-layer connection between nodes of the same type, such as miRNA-miRNA similarity connection and

disease-disease similarity connection. The other type is the inter-layer connection, including miRNA-disease association connection. We define W = Asim, Bmir−dis , where Asim is the intra-layer relationship matrix and Bmir−dis is the interlayer relationship matrix. Asim includes miRNA similarity and disease similarity matrices, defined as
Asim = Amir ∈ RNm×Nm , if vi, vj ∈ V mir
Adis ∈ RNd×Nd , if vi, vj ∈ V dis , (1)
Amir records similarities between Nm miRNAs. The more similar the function of two miRNAs, the more likely they are to be associated with similar diseases. Based on this biological premise and influenced by the strategy of Wang et al. [6], similarity Amir
ij between miri and mirj is calculated using their association with the two groups of diseases. The DAG of a disease usually consists of the disease and its related terms and their associations [6]. Using the Wang et al. technique [6], the semantic similarity Adis
ij between two diseases disi and disj is determined based on their DAGs. The higher the value of Amir
ij Adis
ij , the greater the similarity between miri (disi) and mirj (disj).
Bmir−dis reflects the association between miRNAs and
diseases,
Bmir−dis ∈ RNm×Nd , if vi ∈ V mir, vj ∈ V dis, (2)
each row of Bmir−dis stands in for one miRNA and each
column for one disease. In case miri and disj are related,
then Bmir−dis
ij = 1; otherwise, Bmir−dis
ij = 0.
Given the similarity matrix Amir, Adis and association matrix Bmir−dis, the weight matrix of all edges in G is
W = Amir Bmir−dis
Bmir−dis T Adis ∈ RNv×Nv , (3)
where Bmir−dis T is the transpose matrix for Bmir−dis and Nv = Nm + Nd. All nodes in G are connected by edges to form the adjacency matrix C, C = W . For miRNA or disease nodes, the similarities and associations between them can be considered attributes of the nodes. Therefore, W is considered the attribute matrix of nodes in G and is denoted as X.
C. Learning of semantic information based on various meta-paths
Definition 2. Meta-path. A meta-path is a path with a form of D1
−r1 → D2
−r2 → · · · −rl → Dl+1 , where D1...Dl+1 represent the node types and r1...rl+1 denote the relation types.


4 IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2023
Definition 3. Meta-path instance. For a meta-path q, its instance is a sequence of nodes and the instance follows q’s
definition. For example, mir −r1 → mir −r2 → dis is a metapath, r1 denotes the miRNA similarity, and r2 denotes the miRNA-disease association. mir1 → mir3 → dis9 is one of its instances.
Definition 4. Meta-path-based neighbor. In terms of a meta-path q, the meta-path-based neighbors N D
i of a node i is a group of nodes that connect with i via meta-path instances of q.
Taking miRNA as an example, we established three metapaths miRN A → miRN A, miRN A → disease and miRN A → miRN A → miRN A. First, if the functions of two miRNAs are more similar, they are more likely to associate with similar diseases. The first meta-path (miRN A → miRN A) for the miRNA nodes was constructed based on this biological premise, and the connection semantic within the meta-path is the similarity between two miRNAs. Second, if two miRNAs have associated with more similar diseases, it is more possible that they would associate with similar diseases. Thus, the second meta-path (miRN A → disease) was designed and it contained the semantic reflecting the association between a miRNA and a disease. Third, the third meta-path was also designed based on the same biological premise with that for the first meta-path. Its goal is to obtain the neighbors of a target miRNA’s neighbors, and these highorder neighbors have similar functions with the target miRNA. Thus, the third meta-path (miRN A → miRN A → miRN A) includes two connections and their semantics are the miRNA similarity. Therefore, constructing the meta-paths with various semantic connections could reflect the biological characteristics about the miRNA-disease associations.
The miRNA (disease) node have multiple meta-paths, and each meta-path contains its specific semantic information. For instance, the meta-path miRN A → miRN A includes the similarity semantic information among a target miRNA node and its meta-path neighbors, while the meta-path miRN A → disease contains the association semantic information among the target miRNA node and its meta-path neighbors. Therefore, constructing a separate learning block for each meta-path is helpful for encoding its specific semantic. We built a metapath-guided encoder to learn semantic information (Figure 2).
Because the semantic coding process of miRNAs is similar to that of diseases, we used miRNA as the target node to explain this process. The feature vector of miri is called Xi ∈ X. First, we projected Xi using the mapping matrix WmMP of miRNA node types to form the projected feature vector hi,
hi = μ W MP
m · Xi + bMP
m , (4)
where μ is the activation function tanh and bm MP denotes a bias vector. The type-specific mapping matrix for disease nodes is W MP
d.
Given a meta-path qm, N qm
i is the set of neighboring nodes of miri corresponding to the meta-path. The topology and node attributes in qm are deeply fused to obtain the semantic

D. Learning of miRNA-disease heterogeneous network information
The heterogeneous network G is composed of the miRNA and disease nodes, and the similarity and association connections have their context relationships. A global contextaware graph convolutional autoencoder (GGA) was designed to encode the relationships and form the network-view representations of nodes (Figure 3). GGA encoder.

E. Integrating semantic representation and network-view representation
For a miRNA node miri, the meta-path semantic representation and the network-view representation are ZMP (i) and ZNet (i), respectively. Due to the different contributions of ZMP (i) and ZNet (i) to the miRNA-disease association prediction, the representation-level attention was proposed to adaptively fuse these representations.

T nft (Nm + j) is the node feature fusion representation of disease disj. T nft (i) and T nft (Nm + j) are stitched together left and right to form K. Then we obtained the miri −disj association score snft by feeding K to the fully connected layer and the sof tmax layer,
snft = sof tmax (Wnft · K + bnft) , (16)
where Wnft and bnft denote weight matrix and bias vector of the fully connected layer.
F. Learning of detail and diversity feature enhanced node pair attribute representations
The feature vectors Xi and XNm+j of miRNA miri and disease disj were spliced up and down to obtain the paired attribute embedding H ∈ R2×Nv of miri − disj. A parallel convolutional-deconvolutional network was built to extract diverse pairwise node attributes. As shown in Figure 1(d), the parallel convolution-deconvolution module includes a shallow feature extraction block (SFB), multiple diversity feature extraction blocks (DFB), and a fusion block (FB). The SFB consists of a convolutional layer, H is fed into SFB to form the feature map T s

where δ is the activation function Relu, weight matrix and bias vector are represented by W s
deh and bs
deh, and ’ ∗ ’ denotes the convolution operation. We connected the Ndeh DFBs in series, and the input of each DFB was the output of the previous feature extraction block. As described in Figure 4, each DFB contains two parallel-connected blocks: a convolution block and deconvolution block. The attribute features of the node pair at the original level are extracted using a convolutional block, which consists of one convolutional layer, and T s
deh is the input to the first convolutional block. To learn the edge information of Ts

The deconvolution layer performs an inter-element complementary 0 to the original feature map, stretching its size and making the perceptual field more focused on the local information of the original input. Therefore,
this deconvolution layer can learn representative features at the local level in the feature map. The input of the first deconvolution block is T s

III. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Experimental setup
In this model, we learn the semantic information of metapath miRN A − miRN A, miRN A − disease, miRN A − miRN A − miRN A, disease − disease, disease − miRN A, and disease − disease − disease. The dimension of the feature mapping was 600 and the number of neighbor nodes was 50 in the meta-path-encoding module. The network-view representation learning module had 3 encoding layers and 3 decoding layers, and output feature dimensions of 600 for all of the encoding layers and 700, 900 and 1134 for the decoding layers. In the convolution-deconvolution module, SFB has a convolutional layer with 3 × 3 filters and the model has two DFB blocks. The deconvolution block in a DFB contains a deconvolution layer and a convolution layer. The deconvolution layer stretches the feature map by complementing a 0 among
the original features. It has 2 × 3 filters and the number of filters is 32, and the sliding stride is 1. The convolution layer contains 32 filters with 2 × 2 size and the sliding stride is 2. The convolution block in a DFB has 32 filters with 3 × 3 size and the sliding stride is 1, and the zero-padding is 1. The learning rate was set as 0.0005.
B. Evaluation metrics
The performance of the MDAP and other models used to infer miRNA-associated diseases was assessed using five-fold cross validation. All miRNA-disease associations we know were employed as positive samples, of which 4/5 were used for training and the remaining for testing. Negative samples consisted of all unobserved miRNA-disease associations. Randomly chosen negative samples were added to the training set in an amount equal to the number of positive samples used for training, and the remaining negative samples were used for testing. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) [31], [39] and the area under the precision-recall (PR) curve (AUPR) as evaluation metrics [40]. Prior to obtaining the average of the five outcomes, we first determined the average AUC and AUPR for each fold. Also, biologists typically choose the candidates with the highest rankings for validation. Therefore, we calculate the recall rates for the top-ranked candidates with the highest prediction results and used it as one of the evaluation metrics.
C. Ablation experiments
To confirm the contribution of meta-path semantic learning, network-view feature learning, node pair attribute learning, representation-level attention mechanism, and semantic-level attention mechanism to predict miRNA-disease associations, we ran ablation experiments. As shown in Table I, the final model MDAP achieved the best performance. Without using the meta-path encoding module to learn meta-path semantic

information, the AUC decreased by 1.2%, and the AUPR was 8.6% lower than that of the final model. It showed that integrating the various semantics of multiple meta-paths and the attributes of their neighbors is necessary for the improved prediction performance. Without using the GGA to learn heterogeneous network information, the AUC and AUPR were 1.1% and 6.3% lower than those of the final model. It demonstrated the contribution of features from the heterogeneous network to obtaining the better prediction results. Compared with the model without pairwise attribute learning by the convolutionaldeconvolutional neural networks, the complete model achieved 1.7% of higher AUC and 10.2% of higher AUPR. We replaced the deconvolution with the dilated convolution in our prediction model, and the corresponding prediction performance is shown in the 6th row of Table I. Compared with the dilated convolution strategy, the AUC and AUPR of the deconvolution strategy increased by 1.3% and 11.5%. It indicated learning the more detailed features of the feature map is necessary. Compared to MDAP, the model without the representationlevel attention mechanism showed a decrease of 0.5% and 4.1% in AUC and AUPR, respectively, while the model without the semantic-level attention mechanism displayed a 0.3% and 1.6% decrease in AUC and AUPR, respectively. The main reason is that representation-level attention and semanticlevel attention assign higher weights to more informative node representations and semantic features, which helps to capture the more important features of nodes and improve the prediction performance. The pairwise attribute learning has the most contribution for the prediction performance improvement. On the one hand, the pairwise attribute embedding contains the direct similarity and association information among the pair of miRNA-disease nodes and all the miRNA and disease nodes. On the other hand, the convolutional-deconvolutional neural network is able to learn the more detailed features of the node pair.
D. Comparison with other methods
MDAP was compared with GMDA [31], AEMDA [32], DBNMDA [34], NCMCMDA [16], GSTRW [21], DMPred
[13], PBMDA [11], and Liu’s method [19]. By utilizing the best parameter values available for each method, the best performance of MDAP and the other eight methods was presented. Figure 5 displays the ROC and PR curves for the eight approaches for 341 diseases. For the average AUC across all diseases, MDAP yielded the highest AUC of 0.940, which outperformed GMDA by 1.2%, was 4.9% better than Liu’s method, was superior to PBMDA by 8.3%, was 5% and 3.3% higher than the values of DMPred and DBNMDA, exceeded NCMCMDA by 3.5%, AEMDA by 2.4%, and outperformed the worst performing GSTRW by 13.3 %. Similarly, MDAP obtained the best AUPR value (AUPR = 0.397), which was 14.7%, 30.7%, 21%, 29.8%, 35.7%, 23.1%, 17.8%, and 31.1% higher than GMDA, PBMDA, DBNMDA, Liu’s method, GSTRW, NCMCMDA, AEMDA and DMPred, respectively. In summary, the proposed MDAP model achieves the best performance, with GMDA and AEMDA in the second and third places, respectively. GMDA is based on generative adversarial networks that integrate the neighboring topology of node pairs. AEMDA uses a deep auto-coding model to learn the potential associations. Both ignore the rich semantic information in meta-paths. DBNMDA is based on a deep belief network that deeply integrates the complex relationships between miRNAs and diseases, but does not consider the details of node-pair attributes and edge information. NCMCMDA is a matrix completion-based model that fully utilizes similarity information. The AUC and AUPR values of Liu’s method are similar to those of DMPred, both of which were modeled based on the random walk and non-negative matrix factorization, respectively. The AUPR of PBMDA was a trifle higher than that of DMPred, yet its AUC was 3.3% lower than that of DMPred. GSTRW performed much worse than MDAP, mainly because GSTRW integrated the global similarities among all the miRNAs (diseases) and the information which was obtained by random walking on the miRNA network and the disease network. However, it is a shallow prediction model, and it is difficult for the model to learn the deep and complex features of the miRNA and disease nodes. Most of the compared methods were proposed based on the graph convolutional network, the graph neural network, and the convolutional neural network. They all belong to the deep learning methods and they could mine the deep features of the miRNA and disease nodes. The experimental results demonstrated these methods achieved better prediction performance than GSTRW, which indicates learning the deep features of nodes is necessary. The improvement of MDAP over other methods is mainly because of its in-depth learning of more local and representative features of node-pair attributes and the integration of node features at the network and meta-path levels. We obtained mean five-fold AUC and AUPR results for 341 diseases for each prediction approach. A paired Wilcoxon test was performed using 341 pairwise results when the two methods were compared. The study outcomes are presented in Table II. MDAP showed better performance in both AUC and AUPR, with a p-value of 0.05.The biologists usually select the top-ranked candidates from the prediction results for further wet-lab experimental validation. Therefore, whether there are

the actual miRNA-disease associations among the top-ranked candidates is crucial for the biologists when they select the candidates. The recall rates for the top-ranked candidates may reflect the proportion of the correctly determined positive samples out the total positive samples. Figure 6 displays the recall rates for various top k values. More positive samples were obtained when the recall rate was higher. Our model outperformed other methods for different values of k because of the comprehensive learning of the semantic information of nodes for multiple meta-paths, miRNA-disease network information, and property details of node pairs. MDAP obtained the highest recall rates when k was 30, 60, 90, and 120, with 52.3%, 79.6%, 96.1%, and 98.8%, respectively. The GMDA and AEMDA also achieved acceptable recall rates. The former had recall rates of 45%, 74.2%, 90.6%, and 97%, while the latter had 44.9%, 74.25, 90.4%, and 96.1%. When k in the range of 30–120, the values of NCMCMDA were 45.2%, 68.7%, 79.8%, and 85.7%, respectively. The recall rates for DBNMDA and DMPred were very close, with 44.8%, 69.1%, 80.2%, and 87.6% for the former and 44.7%, 67.4%, 79.1%, and 85.4% for the latter corresponding to the rates. When k=30, Liu’s method ranked 40.2%, and PBMDA ranked 38.8%. When k ranged from 60 to 120, Liu’s method achieved recall rates of 59.5%, 70.5%, and 77.9%, respectively, and PBMDA obtained rates of 58.1%, 68.3%, and 75.2%. The rates of DSTRW were consistently lower than those of the other methods when the k values ranged from 30 to 120, with rates of 21.8%, 37.9%, 48.4%, and 57.6%.
E. Case studies on 3 diseases
To further demonstrate the capability of MDAP to identify potential miRNA-disease associations, we conducted case studies on three diseases, including ovarian neoplasms, lung neoplasms, and breast neoplasms. Using ovarian neoplasms as an example, we obtained the association score of its candidate miRNAs through the model and ranked it in decreasing order. For validation and analysis, the top 50 putative miRNAs for ovarian neoplasms were identified. Supplementary Tables ST1
and ST2 list the top 50 potential miRNAs associated with breast and lung neoplasms, respectively. The miRCancer database contains 9080 experimentally validated miRNA-disease associations, which were extracted from published literature using text mining techniques by Xie et al. [41] and further verified manually. miR2Disease is a database covering 349 miRNAs, 163 diseases, and 3273 miRNA-disease-related information. As indicated in Table III, 37 candidate miRNAs for ovarian neoplasms were identified in miRCancer, and 9 candidate miRNAs were included in miR2Disease. This suggests that the expression of these miRNAs is upregulated or downregulated in ovarian neoplasms. The integrated database dbDEMC stores differentially expressed miRNAs in cancer, as detected using high-throughput and low-throughput methods [42]. The database includes 2224 miRNAs and 36 cancers. In our model, 46 of the 50 miRNA candidates associated with ovarian neoplasms were supported by dbDEMC, implying that they were aberrantly expressed in ovarian neoplasm cells. Among the 50 candidates, 1 candidate miRNA was not confirmed by the observed evidence; hence, it was labeled as “unconfirmed”. Supplementary Table ST1 shows 50 candidate miRNAs for breast neoplasms. miRCancer and miR2Disease contain 33 and 10 candidate miRNAs, respectively, suggesting that these miRNAs may be involved in the development of breast neoplasms. Among the 50 candidate miRNAs for lung neoplasms (Supplementary Table ST2), miRCancer included 43 candidate miRNAs. There were 49 candidates recorded by dbDEMC and 16 candidates by miR2Disease, indicating that these miRNAs were indeed associated with lung neoplasms. All case studies show that MDAP is indeed able to discover potential miRNA-disease associations.
F. Investigation of novel disease-related miRNAs prediction
We utilized MDAP to infer disease-associated miRNA candidates for 341 diseases. In Supplementary Table ST3, the top 50 miRNA candidates for every disease predicted by MDAP are listed.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed a miRNA-disease association prediction method, MDAP, for encoding and fusing the semantics from diverse meta-paths and the topological structure and attributes from the entire miRNA-disease network. The constructed multiple meta-paths for the miRNA (disease) nodes are helpful for capturing the high-order neighbor topologies about these meta-paths to learn the semantic features of the miRNA (disease) nodes. A meta-path-sensitive graph convolution module was built for each meta-path and we integrated the various semantic features of the miRNA and disease nodes from multiple meta-paths. A graph convolutional autoencoder was constructed to capture the topological structure and the node attributes from the entire miRNA-disease heterogeneous network. The designed strategy based on parallel convolutionaldeconvolutional networks is beneficial for the more local and representative features of each miRNA-disease pair. Two attention mechanisms were proposed to assign greater weights for the more informative meta-paths and node representations. Five-fold cross-validation results showed that MDAP achieved higher AUC and AUPR than the compared methods. MDAP also obtained the more actual disease-related miRNAs in the top-ranked prediction candidates. MDAP’s ability in discovering the potential miRNA-disease associations was illustrated through the case studies on 3 diseases which includes ovarian neoplasms, lung neoplasms, and breast neoplasms.
