Abstract
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of novel discovered non-coding RNAs with closed-loop structure, which play critical roles in various biological processes. Identifying associations between circRNAs and diseases is critical for exploring the complex disease mechanism and facilitating disease-targeted therapy. Although several computational predictors have been proposed, their performance is still limited. In this study, a novel computational method called iCircDA-MF is proposed. Because the circRNA-disease associations with experimental validation are very limited, the potential circRNA-disease associations are calculated based on the circRNA similarity and disease similarity extracted from the disease semantic information and the known associations of circRNA-gene, gene-disease and circRNA-disease. The circRNA-disease interaction profiles are then updated by the neighbour interaction profiles so as to correct the false negative associations. Finally, the matrix factorization is performed on the updated circRNA-disease interaction profiles to predict the circRNA-disease associations. The experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that iCircDA-MF outperforms other state-of-the-art predictors and can identify new circRNA-disease associations effectively.

Introduction
As newly discovered non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted more and more attention. Comparing with other linear non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circRNAs lack 5′ and 3′ polyadenylated tails and form a covalently closed continuous loop structure [1]. Existing experimental results indicate that non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in many biological processes [2, 3]. For example, miRNAs normally regulate gene expression via base-pairing with complementary sequences of mRNAs [4]. CircRNAs exert biological functions by acting as miRNA sponges [5], regulators
of RNA binding proteins [6]. Several non-coding RNAs have been confirmed to implicate in the developments of various diseases [7, 8]. For example, CDR1as is one of the earliest well-studied circRNAs, which can regulate miRNAs in tumour cells [9], and it is significantly differentially expressed in many diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma [10], colorectal cancer [11, 12] and neurological disorders [13]. Therefore, identifying potential associations between non-coding RNAs and diseases draws increasing attention to understand the complex disease mechanism and discover therapeutic targets. In the past decade, increasing experimentally supported associations of miRNAdisease and lncRNA-disease have been detected [14–17]; meanwhile, many computational approaches have been proposed

to discover new associations of miRNA-disease [18, 19] and lncRNA-disease [20]. Compared with linear non-coding RNAdisease, the research on circRNA-disease is still in the preliminary stage. The recently constructed experimentally supported circRNA-disease association databases (CircR2Disease [21], Circ2Disease [22], circRNADisease [23]) provide an opportunity to identify the potential circRNA-disease associations via the computational approaches. However, available experimental verified circRNA-disease associations and circRNA-related information are limited. It is still challenging to develop effective predictors to identify circRNA-disease associations from the available circRNA-related information and known circRNAdisease associations. Recently, three computational predictors have been proposed to identify circRNA-disease associations. PWCDA calculates an association score for each circRNA-disease pair based on paths connecting them in a heterogeneous network [24], and DWNN-RLS predicts circRNA-disease associations based on regularized least squares of Kronecker product kernel [25]. KATZHCDA identifies potential circRNA-disease associations by considering the number of walks between nodes and walk length in a heterogeneous network [26]. All the three models have obtained encouraging results, and play important roles in the development of computational methods for circRNAdisease association identification. However, they are suffering from certain problems or limitations: (i) The existing predictors are based on incompletely related biological information, failing to accurately measure the circRNA similarity and disease similarity. (ii) The experimentally verified circRNAdisease associations are very limited, and there are many false negative associations and negative associations. Performed on such noisy and spare circRNA-disease association network, the predictors tend to detect many false negative associations. This study is initiated in an attempt to overcome these problems by developing a novel computational predictor for identifying circRNA-disease associations. The proposed predictor is called iCircDA-MF. The iCircDA-MF predictor has the following advantages: (i) Disease semantic information and the known associations of circRNA-gene, gene-disease, circRNA-disease are employed to accurately measure the circRNA similarity and disease similarity. (ii) The false negative associations can be detected and corrected via the neighbour interaction profiles based on the circRNA similarity and disease similarity. (iii) Matrix factorization is employed to extract the latent features from the noisy and spare circRNAdisease association network. The experimental results on a benchmark dataset showed that iCircDA-MF outperformed other competing methods, and can effectively predict novel circRNA-disease associations. Furthermore, we showed that the performance of iCircDA-MF was underestimated because of the limitation of the known associations with experimental validation.
Materials and Methods
Benchmark dataset
A recently established benchmark dataset circR2Disease [21] based on the experimentally verified circRNA–disease associations was employed to evaluate the performance of various methods. After removing duplicate and non-human circRNAdisease associations, 649 experimentally verified circRNAdisease associations were obtained, including 583 circRNAs and
88 diseases. The benchmark dataset can be represented as
S = S+ ⋃
S−, (1)
where ⋃ is the symbol for union in the set theory, S+ denotes the positive subset that contains 649 experimentally verified circRNA-disease associations and S− is the negative subset that contains 50 655 circRNA-disease associations without experimental validation. The benchmark dataset S is given in Supporting Information S1.
Method overview
In this study, a novel method called iCircDA-MF is proposed to identify potential circRNA-disease associations. The iCircDA-MF consists of three steps, and its framework is shown in Figure 1. Firstly, the similarity matrix of diseases is constructed based on disease semantic information and known circRNA-disease associations. The similarity matrix of circRNAs is constructed based on known associations of circRNA-gene, gene-disease and circRNA-disease. Secondly, reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix is generated based on the interaction profiles of similar circRNAs and similar diseases. Finally, the matrix factorization is exploited to compute the circRNA-disease association scores.
Construct disease similarity matrix
Disease similarity based on Gaussian interaction profile kernel
Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel was proposed to calculate the network topologic similarity of biological entities [27], and it has been widely applied to construct disease similarity matrix [28–30]. According to the biological assumption that similar diseases show similar interaction patterns with circRNAs [24–26], the topologic information of circRNA-disease association network can be used to measure disease similarity. Therefore, GIP kernel was used to calculate the similarity between diseases DGip
(
di, dj
)
as follows [27]:
DGip
(di, dj
) = exp
(
−γd
∥∥A (di
) − A (dj
)∥∥2 )
, (2)
where
A=

⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ (3)
γd = γd′/
( 1 n
n ∑
i=1
∥∥A (di

)
, (4)
where the binary vector A
( di
)
is the ith column in matrix A, which is the interaction profile of disease di representing whether disease di is associated with each circRNA or not. γd is a regulation parameter, which controls the kernel bandwidth.γd′ is the original bandwidth and is defined as 1 according to the previous study [27]. A is the adjacency matrix of circRNA-disease association dataset S (cf. (1)). m is the number of circRNAs, and n is the number of diseases. The element ai,j in row i column j of A is 1 if circRNA ci is related to the disease dj with experimental validation, otherwise 0. The size of DGip is n×n, and
DGip
(
di, dj
)
represents the GIP kernel similarity score between di and dj.

Disease similarity based on disease semantic
Disease can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on its semantic associations of terms in ontology, where nodes denote diseases and edges denote associations between diseases. Similar diseases will share more common parts of DAGs. One of the most popular methods for computing the similarity of terms in ontology was proposed by Wang et al. [31], and it has been widely utilized for computing the semantic similarity of diseases in recent years [29, 32–34]. In this study, disease semantic related annotation terms were obtained from the Disease Ontology [35]. The disease semantic similarity matrix Dsem can be calculated by [32–34]:
Dsem
(di, dj
)=
∑
t∈Tdi
⋂ Tdj
(
Sdi (t) + Sdj (t)
)
∑
t∈Tdi
Sdi (t) + ∑
t∈Tdj
Sdj (t) , (5)
where Dsem
(
di, dj
)
denotes the semantic similarity score between disease di and dj. Td denotes the set of diseases in the DAG graph of disease d, and Sd(t) denotes the semantic contribution of disease t ∈ Td related to disease d calculated by
{
Sd(t) = max {ω ∗ Sd (t′) |t′ ∈ children of (t)} Sd(t) = 1
if t = d
otherwise , (6) where ω is the semantic contribution factor, which is set as 0.5 following the previous study [33].
Construct integrated disease similarity matrix
Measuring disease similarity from different perspectives can generate a more comprehensive view of similarity between diseases. Based on the aforementioned similarity measures, the two disease similarity matrices DGip(cf. (2)) and Dsem(cf. (5)) can be obtained and integrated to provide a more comprehensive disease similarity, where DGip represents the network topologic similarity between diseases and Dsem describes the semantic similarity between diseases. Because some diseases have no corresponding disease semantic terms, we merged the two similarity matrices following previous studies [36, 37] so as to complement the missing similarity information of Dsem. The final disease similarity matrix SD was computed by [36, 37]:
SD (di, dj
)=
{ Dsem(di,dj)+DGip(di,dj) 2 DGip
(di, dj
) if Dsem
(di, dj
)=0
otherwise . (7)
The size of SD is n×n; each element in the matrix SD indicates the similarity score between diseases.
Construct circRNA similarity matrix
CircRNA similarity based on GIP kernel
GIP kernel has also been widely utilized to calculate biomolecule similarity [38–40]. Because similar circRNAs tend to show similar associations with diseases [24–26], the circRNA similarity matrix CGip
(
ci, cj
)
was calculated by GIP kernel [27] based on the

circRNA-disease association network:
CGip
(ci, cj
) = exp
(
−γc
∥∥A (ci) − A (cj
)∥∥2 )
(8)
γc = γc′/
( 1 m
∑m
i=1

)
, (9)
where the binary vector A
( ci
)
is the ith row in the adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)), which is the interaction profile of circRNA ci representing whether circRNA ci is associated with each disease or not. γc is a regulation parameter, which controls the kernel bandwidth.γc′ is the original bandwidth and is defined as 1 based on [27]. The size of CGip is m × m, and CGip
(
ci, cj
)
represents the GIP kernel similarity score between circRNA ci and cj.
CircRNA similarity based on gene-related similarity
It is known that circRNAs can act as competing endogenous RNAs to regulate genes [41]. Because similar RNAs tend to regulate similar genes, genes have been widely used to infer RNA similarity [42, 43]. In this study, gene-disease associations were collected from HumanNet v2 [44, 45]. CircRNAs and their related gene target information were downloaded from circR2Disease [21]. Considering the close relevance between genes and circRNAs, circRNA gene-related similarity matrix Cgenewas calculated by
Cgene = R × G × RT, (10)
where T is the transpose operator. R is a matrix representing the relevance of circRNAs and genes; the elements in R are 1 if circRNAs and genes are relevant, otherwise they are 0. G is the GIP kernel similarity matrix for genes, which is computed based on gene-disease associations. The element in Cgene represents similarity score between each two circRNAs from their gene regulation perspective.
Construct integrated circRNA similarity matrix
Through the above similarity measures, two circRNA similarity matrices can be obtained, including CGip (cf. (8)),Cgene (cf. (10)). However, Cgene is incompleteness because some circRNAs in the circRNA-disease association dataset S (cf. (1)) lack the corresponding experimentally supported circRNA-gene associations. In this regard, the two similarity matrices were merged to complement the missing similarity information by [36, 37]:
SC (ci, cj
)=
{ Cgene(ci,cj)+CGip(ci,cj) 2 CGip
(ci, cj
) if Cgene
(ci, cj
)=0
otherwise . (11)
The size of SC is m×m; each element in the matrix SC indicates the similarity score between circRNAs.
Reformulate circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix
The elements in the original circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)) are binary values, representing whether circRNAs are associated with diseases or not. Because the known circRNA-disease associations are still limited, there are many false negative associations whose values are zero in A (cf. (3)). In order to reduce the noise, the circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)) was reformulated based on [46].
The vertical direction reformulation
For each disease dp, all other diseases were ranked in descending order according to their similarities with dp. In the reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix Ad, the interaction profile for dp was calculated based on the corresponding interaction profiles of the top k similar diseases with dp [46]:
Ad
(dp
)= 1
Wd
∑k
q=1SD (dp, dq
) × A (dq
) , (12)
where Wd = ∑
1≤q≤k SD
(
dp, dq
)
, SD (cf. (7)) is the disease similarity
matrix. A
( dq
)
represents the corresponding interaction profile of disease dq, which is the qth column of original association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)).
The horizontal direction reformulation
For each circRNA ci, all other circRNAs were ranked in descending order according to their similarities with ci. In the reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix Ac, the interaction profile for ci was calculated based on the corresponding interaction profiles of the top k similar circRNAs with ci [46]:
Ac (ci) = 1
Wc
∑k
j=1SC (ci, cj
) × A (cj
) , (13)
where Wc = ∑
1≤j≤k SC
(
ci, cj
)
, SC (cf. (11)) is the circRNA similarity
matrix. A
( cj
)
represents the corresponding interaction profile of circRNA ci, which is the ith row of original association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)).
Final reformulation
The two reformulated matrices Ad and Ac were merged by
Acd =
(
Ac + Ad
)
/2. The final reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A′ was calculated by
A′ = max (A, Acd) . (14)
Predict circRNA-disease association by matrix factorization
As matrix factorization can detect the intrinsic structure of data effectively; it shows powerful ability to identify meaningful information in recommendation problems [47–49]. In recent years, identifying associations between two biological entities can be considered as recommendation problem. Matrix factorization has been successfully applied to detect potential associations of drug-target [46, 50, 51], miRNA-disease [37, 38, 52–54], lncRNA-disease [55, 56], etc. In this study, iCircDA-MF is based on basic non-negative matrix factorization, which can detect the latent features from sparse matrix and ensure the nonnegativity of the predictive association scores. The reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A′ (cf. (14)) can be decomposed into two low-dimension matrices via optimizing the following objective function [57, 58]:
minC,D
∥∥A′ − CDT∥∥2
F s.t. C ≥ 0, D ≥ 0, (15)

1360 Wei and Liu
where C and D are the latent feature matrices of circRNAs and diseases, and their dimensions are m × r and n × r, respectively. r is the subspace dimensionality, T is the transpose operator and
∥∥∥ •
∥∥∥F represents Frobenius norm [59]. Because similar circRNAs tend to be associated with same or similar diseases and vice versa, two biological constraint terms are considered. For circRNAs, if two circRNAs are similar, the distance between their latent feature vectors is close. Two data points in the disease latent feature space are close to each other if their corresponding diseases are similar. It has been proved that the graph Laplacian can help reduce noise [60] and enhance predictive performance [54] by constraining the geometrical structure of latent feature space [61]. To further reduce the noise in A′ (cf. (14)) and ensure the biological meaning of the latent feature spaces, two biological constraint terms based on graph regularization are introduced and formularized as follows:
1 2
∑m i,j=1
∥∥C (ci) − C (cj
)∥∥2 SC
ij = Tr (CTGCC)
1 2
∑n
p,q=1
∥∥D (dp
) − D (dq
)∥∥2SpDq = Tr (DTGDD) , (16)
where the Euclidean norm is used to measure the distance in each latent feature space. SC (cf. (11)) and SD (cf. (7)) are circRNA similarity matrix and disease similarity matrix. C
( ci
)
and D
( dp
)
are the ith and pth rows of C and D, representing the feature vectors for circRNA ci and disease dp. Tr
( •
)
represents the trace of a matrix. GC = IC − SC and GD = ID − SD are the graph Laplacian matrices for circRNA similarity matrix and disease similarity matrix, respectively. IC and ID are two diagonal matrices; the elements in IC and ID are row sums of SC and SD, respectively. Finally, Frobenius norm regularization term is added to avoid overfitting and ensure the smoothness of target space. Therefore, integrating basic objective function (cf. (15)), two graph regularization terms (cf. (16)) and Frobenius norm regularization term, the final objective function in iCircDA-MF is formularized as follows:
minC,D
∥∥A′ − CDT∥∥2
F + α∥∥CDT∥∥2
F + β (Tr (CTGCC) + Tr (DTGDD))
s.t. C ≥ 0, D ≥ 0 , (17) where α and β are regularization coefficients. We solved the optimization problem by introducing Lagrange multipliers and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions [62]. Through calculating the partial derivative for C and D, the updating rules for C
(
cit
)
and
D
(
dpt
)
are as follows:
C (cit) = C (cit)
(
A′ D+βSC C
)
it ((α+1)CDT D+βIC C)it
D (dpt
) = D (dpt
) ((A′)TC+βSDD
)
pt ((α+1)DCT C+βID D)pt
. (18)
The low-dimension latent feature matrices C and D were updated via (18) until convergence. Finally, the predicted circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix was obtained by A∗ = CDT. The larger value of the element in A∗ represents the higher relevance between the corresponding circRNA and disease.
Performance evaluation
In this study, to evaluate the performance of iCircDA-MF on identifying circRNA-disease associations, two cross-validation approaches were implemented, including 5-fold cross-validation and disease-specific cross-validation. For K-fold cross-validation (K = 5 in this study) [63], benchmark dataset S (cf. (1)) is randomly divided into K subsets as follows:
{
S = S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Si · · · ∪ SK = ⋃K
i=1 Si
∅ = S1 ∩ S2 ∩ · · · ∩ Si · · · ∩ SK = ⋂K

i ; S−
i is the ith negative sub subset containing the circRNA-disease associations without experimental validation and
∣∣∣S−

i . Then, one of the subsets is taken as a test set in turn and the remaining K-1 subsets are used as training sets. For disease-specific cross-validation [24], the positive subset S+ (cf. (1)) and the negative subset S− (cf. (1)) can be formulated as

Results and discussion
Parameter optimization
It can be seen that the process of reformulating circRNAdisease association adjacency matrix contains a parameter k representing the size of neighbour interaction profiles. Three parameters: r, α, β in the matrix factorization (see (17)), where r represents the subspace dimensionality of latent feature matrix and α and β are two regularization parameters. In this study, parameter combinations were considered from the following ranges:
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
0 ≤ k ≤ 5, 40 ≤ r ≤ 80,
α = 2 × 10−i, β = 1 × 10−i,
with step k = 1 with step r = 10
with 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 with 1 ≤ i ≤ 3
. (24)
Because the neighbour interaction profiles size k and the subspace dimensionality r are closely related to the number of known circRNA-disease associations, the impacts of k and r on the predictive performance of iCircDA-MF were analysed, and shown in Figure 2a and b, respectively, from which we can see the following: (i) The lowest AUC score is obtained when k = 0 representing no neighbour interaction profile information is used to reformulate the sparse circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)). (ii) Compared the performance of iCircDA-MF when k = 0, its performance improves rapidly when k = 1, and then turns stable, indicating that reformulation of sparse circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix based on the neighbour interaction profiles can improve the performance of iCircDA-MF. (iii) The predictive performance of iCircDA-MF improves as the value of r increases. iCircDA-MF performs best when r = 70, and turns stable at r = 80. The final optimum parameter combinations were optimized based on the AUC scores by 5-fold cross-validation, and their optimized values are k = 2, r = 70,α = 2 × 10−3, β = 1 × 10−3.
Incorporating more association information via neighbour interaction profiles
The known circRNA-disease associations in the original circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)) are limited, and most unknown associations are incorrectly labelled as uncorrelated circRNA-disease associations. Based on the biological assumption that similar diseases show similar interaction patterns with circRNAs, and vice versa [24–26], the association information in the original circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)) can be supplemented by the interaction profiles of similar diseases and similar circRNAs. This reformulation approach has been successfully used in drug-target interaction prediction [46]. To illustrate the effect of reformulation of the original sparse association adjacency matrix A (cf. (3)), a graphical illustration for generating reformulated association adjacency matrix A′ (cf. (14)) is shown in Figure 3, from which we can see the following: (i) The reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix from horizontal direction Ac (cf. (13)) based on the interaction profiles of similar circRNAs and that from vertical direction Ad (cf. (12)) based on the interaction profiles of similar diseases can introduce additional association information. (ii) Compared with the original sparse circRNA-disease association matrix A (cf. (3)), the final reformulated circRNA-disease association matrix A′ (cf. (14)) is able to correct some false negative associations by assigning their corresponding association scores.
Comparison with highly related methods
To evaluate the performance of iCircDA-MF, 5-fold crossvalidation (cf. (19)) was implemented. The performance of iCircDA-MF was compared with five state-of-the-art predictors, including PWCDA [24], RWRHCD [24], HGICD [24], DWNN-RLS [25] and KATZHCDA [26]. Table 1 lists the performance of various methods, from which we can see that the iCircDA-MF obviously outperforms other methods. PWCDA, RWRHCD, HGICD and KATZHCDA are four network-based methods, which construct a bipartite graph by connecting the circRNA network and

disease network using the known circRNA-disease. RWRHCD and HGIMDA infer potential circRNA-disease associations via different extended random walk iterative processing. With iteration increasing, more paths of long length will be introduced in the sparse circRNA-disease network, which may produce much noisy and meaningless information and lead to poor predictive performance. PWCDA and KATZHCDA perform better because they calculate an association score for each circRNAdisease pair by summarizing all paths with a fixed small path length considering the limited experimentally validated circRNA-disease associations. To overcome the problem of sparse known circRNA-disease associations, iCircDA-MF and DWNN-RLS incorporate additional association information by fusing different information sources. DWNN-RLS infers circRNAdisease associations based on regularized least squares of Kronecker product kernel. Compared with DWNN-RLS, iCircDAMF achieves higher predictive performance, because it can effectively reduce noisy information by considering the geometrical structure and biological meaning of the decomposed
low-dimension feature space of circRNAs and diseases in the process of matrix factorization.
Performance for predicting disease specific associations
In order to further illustrate the predictive results of iCircDAMF for identifying related circRNAs with specific diseases, the diseases in benchmark dataset S (cf. (1)) were sorted in descending order by their number of experimentally verified associated circRNAs, and the top 10 diseases with most associated circRNAs were selected, and predicted by iCircDAMF via the disease-specific cross-validation (cf. (23)). The results were shown in Table 2, from which we can see the following: (i) The proposed iCircDA-MF predictor is able to accurately identify the associations between circRNAs and the 10 diseases with AUC scores higher than 0.93. (ii) Among the 10 diseases, 2 diseases (‘Colorectal cancer’ and ‘Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma’) were also predicted by three related methods, including PWCDA

Case studies
To illustrate the capability of iCircDA-MF for predicting novel circRNA-disease associations based on the known associations, the performance of iCircDA-MF was further evaluated for predicting novel associated circRNAs for three important diseases, including lung cancer, liver cancer and pancreatic cancer. For each cancer, all the known associations in S+ (cf. (1)) were used to train iCircDA-MF, and the remaining unknown cancer-circRNA pairs were considered as candidates for testing. Then, all the candidates were sorted by the predicted association scores. circ2Disease [22], circRNADisease [23] and literatures in PubMed were used to confirm the predicted associations. Table 3 and Figure 4 show the association networks of the top 10 circRNAs with highest association scores for each cancer predicted by iCircDA-MF, from which we can see the following: (i) Among the top ranked circRNAs, ‘hsa circ 0000284’ and ‘has circ 0001946’ are observed to be related to multiple cancers, indicating that the two circRNAs may play crucial roles in the development of cancers. (ii) Most of the predicted circRNAs are really associated with the corresponding cancers (blue circles and lines in Figure 4) as their associations are supported by circ2Disease [22], circRNADisease [23] or experimental literatures in PubMed. For example, ‘hsa circ 0000284’ promotes human lung cancer cell proliferation via circHIPK3/miR-379 pathway [67] and regulates pancreatic carcinoma proliferation through the IL6-STAT3 pathway [68]. ‘hsa circ 0023404’ is overexpressed in the lung cancer cell [69]. ‘hsa circRNA 103096’, ‘hsa circRNA 102032’, ‘hsa circRNA 400031’, ‘hsa circRNA 100571’ and ‘hsa circRNA 102347’ are top 5 ranked predicted circRNAs associated with liver cancer, which are significantly differentially expressed
between patients of liver cancer following liver transplantation and healthy individuals [70]. ‘hsa circ 0041150’ is proved to be dysregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, and is proposed to serve as potential roles in pancreatic cancer [71]. The case studies further illustrate that iCircDA-MF can predict reliable novel circRNA-disease associations, and provide valuable circRNA candidates for biological experiments to study the mechanism of diseases.
The performance of iCircDA-MF is underestimated
The benchmark dataset S (cf. (1)) treats the circRNA-disease associations with experimental validation as the positive samples, and the circRNA-disease associations without experimental validation as the negative samples. However, the experimentally verified circRNA-disease associations are very limited. As shown in the above case studies, many circRNA-disease associations without experimental validation in fact are really circRNAdisease associations. In other words, the predicted circRNAdisease associations by iCircDA-MF labelled as false positives would be true positives, and therefore, its performance would be underestimated. In order to answer this question, we did the following experiment. The label of each association without experimental validation a in S− (cf. (1)) was inferred by
L(a) =
{ 1 0
if A′(a) ≥ λ
otherwise , (25)
where L(a) = 1 means inferring a as positive, and infer a as negative when L(a) = 0. A′(a) represents the predicted association score of a in the reformulated circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix A′ (cf. (14)). λ is a threshold of inferring association label. Figure 5a shows the number of associations without experimental validation inferred as positives based on different values

of λ, and Figure 5b lists their corresponding AUC scores. From Figure 5, we can draw the following conclusions: (i) The performance of iCircDA-MF can be improved by correcting some negatives as positives based on (25). (ii) Higher λ values result in less added positives, and therefore limited performance improvement is observed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of iCircDA-MF based on original labels and corrected labels are shown in Figure 6, from which we can see that the performance of iCircDA-MF is really underestimated. In other words, with the increment of the circRNA-disease associations with experimental validation, the performance of iCircDA-MF will increase as well. This problem also exists in other fields,
such as protein disordered region prediction [72], etc. A possible solution is to construct the computational models in a semi-supervised manner trained with the high quality positive samples constructed by the circRNA-disease associations with experimental validation and unlabelled data.
Conclusion
In recent years, more and more experiments have verified that circRNAs are closely related to the development of various diseases. Therefore, identifying associations between circRNAs and diseases can help understand the complex

disease mechanisms and facilitate disease-targeted therapy. It is necessary to develop computational methods to identify circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we have proposed a novel computational method called iCircDA-MF to identify circRNA-diseases associations. Experimental results showed that it outperformed other state-of-the-art predictors, and can identify new circRNAdiseases associations effectively. Furthermore, we also showed that the performance of iCircDA-MF was underestimated with the current known associations. We anticipate that with the growth of the experimentally validated associations, the predictive performance of iCircDA-MF will be improved and objectively estimated as well. Three main factors attribute to the performance of iCircDAMF: (i) iCircDA-MF incorporates multiple biological information to measure circRNA similarity and disease similarity. (ii) A preprocessing step of reformulating the sparse circRNA-disease association adjacency matrix based on their neighbour interac
tion profiles is employed so as to correct the false negatives in the original association adjacency matrix, and makes iCircDAMF applicable for predicting the associations of new diseases and circRNAs. (iii) iCircDA-MF computes the association scores based on matrix factorization, which is able to detect meaningful latent features from sparse matrix. The proposed iCircDA-MF achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying circRNA-disease associations, but it would be further improved by addressing the following problems. The similarity measurement for circRNAs are only based on the available networks with undetected interactions, leading to noise information and bias to the circRNAs with more known interactions. Because circRNAs sharing similar sequences tend to be associated with similar disease, the sequence-based similarity measure will be useful for calculating circRNA similarity. The disease similarity can be more accurately measured by other disease similarity methods, such as disease functional similarity [73], disease module similarity [74], etc. Finally, more advanced matrix factorization techniques can be applied to remove the noise and discover potential circRNA-disease associations, such as DNRLMF-MDA [38], LWSG NMF [75], etc.
Key Points
• Due to the circular RNAs (circRNAs) having a close relationship with the progression of various human diseases, it is critical for developing effective computational predictors for circRNA-disease association prediction. • A predictor called iCircDA-MF was proposed, which incorporated more association information based on the circRNA similarity and disease similarity, and employed matrix factorization to extract the latent features from a new circRNA-disease association network. • Performance on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that iCircDA-MF outperforms other state-ofthe-art predictors. Furthermore, some case studies showed that iCircDA-MF is also able to discover new circRNA-disease associations accurately.
