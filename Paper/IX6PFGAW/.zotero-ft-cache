circRNA-disease association DeepWalk Network consistency projection Similarity learning
ABSTRACT
A growing body of experimental studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are of interest in pathogenicity mechanism research and are becoming new diagnostic biomarkers. As experimental techniques for identifying disease-circRNA interactions are costly and laborious, some computational predictors have been advanced on the basis of the integration of biological features about circRNAs and diseases. However, the existing circRNA-disease relationships are not well exploited. To solve this issue, a novel method named DeepWalk and network consistency projection for circRNA-disease association prediction (DWNCPCDA) is proposed. Specifically, our method first reveals features of nodes learned by the deep learning method DeepWalk based on known circRNA-disease associations to calculate circRNA-circRNA similarity and disease-disease similarity, and then these two similarity networks are further employed to feed to the network consistency projection method to predict unobserved circRNA-disease interactions. As a result, DWNCPCDA shows high-accuracy performances for disease-circRNA interaction prediction: an AUC of 0.9647 with leave-one-out cross validation and an average AUC of 0.9599 with five-fold cross validation. We further perform case studies to prioritize latent circRNAs related to complex human diseases. Overall, this proposed method is able to provide a promising solution for disease-circRNA interaction prediction, and is capable of enhancing existing similarity-based prediction methods.
1. Introduction
Circular RNA (circRNA) is a newly discovered endogenous noncoding RNA that is generated through back-splicing processes, thus presenting as a closed loop structure. For decades, circRNA was once thought to result from splicing artifacts [1]. Only recently have more and more circRNAs been found in eukaryotic cells [2–4]. Further, studies have shown that certain circRNAs display the role of miRNA sponges [5] and show differential abundance between tumor and normal cells [6,7]. For example, Vo et al. [6] detected more than 160,000 differentially expressed circRNAs through capture sequencing across over 2,000 tumor specimens and identified prostate cancerrelated circRNAs in urine. Combined, deregulated circRNA expression
is correlated with initiation and progression of disease, including cancer. Importantly, circRNAs are an ideal biomarkers because they are more stable compared with other linear non-coding RNA molecules [8–10]. Therefore, the identification of disease-circRNA relationships is facilitated to elucidate the mechanisms of circRNA functional roles as well as develop new drugs. In the past few years, many novel bioinformatics algorithms have been advanced to predict latent interactions between diseases and non-coding RNAs, such as disease-miRNA [11–13] and disease-lncRNA [14–16]. However, the research on disease-circRNA association prediction is just the beginning compared to linear noncoding RNA-disease. Recently, several databases of disease-circRNA associations collected from experimental literatures have emerged [17–19], which provide

valuable resources for the exploration of disease-circRNA correlations via computational methods. For example, as the first model of diseasecircRNA association prediction, PWCDA first constructed a heterogeneous network based on circRNA and disease similarity data and known disease-circRNA associations, and then applied path weighted method to the constructed network to infer latent disease-associated circRNAs [20]. Another heterogeneous network-based model named KATZHCDA was proposed by Fan et al. [21]. They integrated known disease-circRNA correlations and different types of disease and circRNA similarity into a heterogeneous graph and implemented KATZ algorithm on the constructed graph to rank candidates. Meanwhile, Yan et al. [22] brought out a method called DWNN-RLS to simultaneously uncover underlying candidates for all diseases by employing regularized least squares built with Kronecker product kernel. By making full use of the inherent features of diseases and circRNAs, Xiao et al. [23] devised a computational framework in which association probability of each circRNA-disease pair were updated by low-rank approximation algorithm. Considering that there are many missing associations in the known datasets, Wei et al. [24] first derived neighbor interaction profiles based on disease and circRNA similarity and then employed matrix factorization algorithm to excavate unobserved disease-circRNA relationships. Later, label propagation algorithm was applied to the prediction of circRNA-disease interactions, which can efficiently transfer association label information on circRNA and/or disease similarity networks. For example, CD-LNLP [25] introduced linear neighborhood similarity and LLCDC [26] employed locality-constrained linear coding for constructing the similarity network when applying label propagation. By integrating known disease-protein associations and protein-circRNA interactions, Deng et al. [27] constructed an inferred disease-circRNA interaction network and then adopted KATZ method to measure the relevance for each disease-circRNA pair. Li et al. [28] introduced network consistency projection algorithm to effectively discover potential circRNAs for diseases. Lei et al. [29] presented a computational model termed ICFCDA using collaboration filtering algorithm based on known disease-circRNA associations and multiple types of disease and circRNA similarity data. Recently, Lei et al. [30] further proposed a model for the prediction task, which extracted the weighted features using random walk with restart to train k-nearest neighbors classifier. Existing computational approaches make use of additional biological information the circRNAs and diseases have. However, the known circRNA-disease association network is not well exploited and features of vertices in the network are rarely taken into account. Network embedding methods can extract embeddings of nodes in a network, which can be adapted to compute topological similarities between nodes [31,32]. Consequently, we can utilize the similarities to make predictions by adapting the existing similarity-based approaches. In this paper, a computational method named DeepWalk and network consistency projection for circRNA-disease association prediction (DWNCPCDA) is proposed. An important innovation of DWNCPCDA is that it adopts DeepWalk, a network embedding method, to learn embeddings of nodes in the known circRNA-disease association network, which can be incorporated with similarity-based methods to provide more flexibility for circRNA-disease prediction. Cross validation and case studies are carried out to comprehensively evaluate the prediction performance of DWNCPCDA, and the simulation results indicate that our proposed method could be served as a promising tool and be beneficial to the field of disease-circRNA interaction prediction.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Datasets
There are several databases about circRNA-disease associations collected from experimental literatures, such as Circ2Disease [17], CircR2Disease [18] and circRNADisease [19]. Among these three databases, CircR2Disease is the latest and owns the most association
datasets, including 661 circRNAs, 100 diseases and 739 interactions. Then we remove non-human and redundant correlations, and eventually obtain 650 associations involving 585 circRNAs and 88 diseases. Therefore, we select the CircR2Disease database as the benchmark dataset for cross validation. Considering that the CircR2Disease database contains more known association pairs than another two datasets (i.e., Circ2Disease and circRNADisease) and there are still very lack of known associations currently, we implement DWNCPCDA on the circRNADisease dataset for case studies and confirm the predicted relationships in CircR2Disease. We compile the dataset from circRNADisease, which consists of 332 interactions between 40 diseases and 312 circRNAs. The known association dataset between m diseases and n circRNAs can be modelled as a bipartite graph, in which diseases and circRNAs are considered as vertices and their relationships are considered as edges. This graph can be further encoded as a m × n adjacency matrix M. Concretely, if the i-th disease is connected to the j-th circRNA, M(i, j) = 1; otherwise, M(i, j) = 0.
2.2. DWNCPCDA method
As mentioned above, most existing computational approaches depend on additional biological information the circRNAs and diseases have, such as circRNA expression profiles and disease ontology. However, topology features of vertices learned from known disease-circRNA interaction network are rarely taken into account, which can preserve the structural property of the network efficiently. In biomedical research, DeepWalk [31], a network embedding method, has been successfully applied to predict protein function [33], detect drug target interactions [34] and excavate links between diseases and miRNAs [35]. Therefore, we first adopt DeepWalk to disclose feature vectors of vertices in the known circRNA-disease association network for calculating the circRNA-circRNA similarity and disease-disease similarity, and then these two similarity networks are used as input to the network consistency projection method to obtain the predicted disease-circRNA relationships. The flowchart of DWNCPCDA is shown in Fig. 1. DWNCPCDA can be found at https://github.com/ghli16/DWNCPCDA.
2.2.1. Similarity learning with DeepWalk
DeepWalk is a deep unsupervised learning model, which can generate low-dimensional embedding vectors of vertices in the bipartite circRNA-disease network. This approach utilizes truncated random walks and SkipGram [36] to learn the vector-based representation of vertices. For starters, truncated random walks that γ random walks of length t for each vertex vi are performed. Then, the SkipGram model is implemented to learn the embedding vector of vertex vi for each random walk. SkipGram maximally compute the co-occurrence likelihood among the nodes that come into view within a path of window w, and its objective function is as follows:
mΦin logPr({vi w, ⋯, vi+w}\vi|Φ(vi)) (1)
Here Ф means the vector-based representation related to each node vi, which is a (m + n) × d low-dimensional space matrix, where d indicates the dimension of node representation. SkipGram further approximates the above conditional probability using the assumption as follows:
Pr({vi w, ⋯, vi+w}\vi|Φ(vi)) =
i+ ∏w
j=i w,j=∕i
Pr vj
⃒⃒ Φ(vi)) (2)
To reduce the computational time of calculating Pr(vj|Ф(vi)), Hierarchical Softmax [37] is used to factorize the conditional probability by assigning the vertices of a walking sequence to the leaves of a binary tree as equation (3) shows:

Pr vj
⃒⃒ Φ(vi)) =
⌈log ∏|V |⌉
l=1
1/ 1 + e Φ(vi)⋅ψ(bl)) (3)
where (b0, b1,...,blog|v|) represents a sequence of tree nodes starting at the root and ending at vj (i.e., b0 = root and b&tnqh_0250Clog|v| &tnqh_02510= vj). ψ(bl) denotes the embedding vectors associated with the parent of tree node bl. More details about DeepWalk are sketched in Ref. [31]. After applying DeepWalk to the circRNA-disease association network, we can obtain the embedding matrix Ф. Each row of Ф is a ddimensional embedding vector corresponding to the latent topological representation of each disease node and circRNA node. Therefore, the cosine similarity between two embedding vectors can be calculated as the similarity of two disease (or circRNA) nodes, and the similarity between two nodes, vi and vj, is formulated as follows:
Sim vi, vj
)=
d ∑
k=1
Φ(vi, k)Φ vj, k) ̅ ̅̅ d ∑
k=1
Φ(vi, k)2
√ ̅ ̅̅ d ∑
k=1
Φ vj, k)2
√ (4)
where Ф(vi, k) and Ф(vj, k) are the k-th components of embedding vector Ф(vi) and Ф(vj), respectively. According to equation (4), we can construct a circRNA topological similarity matrix Simc and a disease topological similarity matrix Simd, respectively.
2.2.2. Network consistency projection
Based on the above two similarity matrices, we capitalize on a simple
and efficient network-based method, network consistency projection [38], to discover the potential disease-circRNA linkages in the view of circRNA space projection and disease space projection. From the view of circRNA space projection, the association score can be calculated by projecting circRNA similarity network on the known association network. The projection of vector form is formulated as follows:
CSP(i, j) = M(i, : ) × Simc( :, j)
|M(i, : )| (5)
where M(i, :) is a 1 × n vector extracted from the i-th row of adjacency matrix M; Simc(:, j) is a n × 1 vector generated from j-th column of circRNA similarity matrix Simc; |M(i, :)| represents the modulus of vector M(i, :). As the adjacency matrix M is very sparse and most of the nonassociated disease-circRNA pairs are actually missing interactions, we
use a small positive value (10-30) to replace 0 in M, which will not affect the prediction results and avoid the denominator being 0. According to equation (5), we can obtain the projection score of Simc on M, which is
denoted as the circRNA space projection matrix CSP ∈ Rm×n, where the element CSP(i, j) is the projection value of Simc(:, j) on M(i, :). From the view of disease space projection, another relevance score can be calculated by projecting disease similarity network on the known association network. The projection of vector form is formulated as follows:
DSP(i, j) = Simd(i, : ) × M( :, j)
|M( :, j)| (6)
where M(:, j) is a m × 1 vector extracted from the j-th column of adjacency matrix M and Simd(i, :) is a 1 × m vector generated from i-th

row of disease similarity matrix Simd. According to equation (6), we can obtain the projection score of Simd on M, which is represented as the
disease space projection matrix DSP ∈ Rm×n, where the element DSP(i, j) is the projection value of Simd(i, :) on M(:, j). Finally, we take the integration and normalization of the above two projection score matrices CSP and DSP as the final output:
NCP(i, j) = CSP(i, j) + DSP(i, j)
|Simd(i, : )| + |Simc( :, j)| (7)
where NCP denotes the final prediction score matrix for potential disease-circRNA associations. Network consistency projection is a simple and efficient networkbased method that has already shown excellent performance in link prediction research [28,38]. The model does not need negative instances and can simultaneously excavate candidate circRNAs for all diseases on a large scale. Moreover, by adopting network consistency projection, we could handle limited association data efficiently.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Evaluation metrics
To evaluate how well the constructed model can predict, the most popular approach is K-fold cross validation. In the framework of K-fold cross validation, the entire dataset (i.e., all labeled circRNA-disease pairs), is divided into K folds evenly, of which one-fold of data is set as testing sample and the other folds are used as training set in turns. We can obtain a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each fold, and then an AUC (i.e., area under the ROC curve) value can be calculated. Finally, the AUC values for all K folds are averaged to obtain the final metric. Here K is set at 5 (i.e., 5-fold cross validation) and the number of known circRNA-disease associations (i.e., leave-one-out cross validation), respectively. Considering that the circRNA-circRNA and disease-disease similarities computed with DeepWalk depend on labeled circRNA-disease pairs, we need to recalculate them in each fold.
3.2. Parameter analysis
DeepWalk contains five parameters: γ, t, w, d, and α, where γ is the number of random walks started at each node, t is the walk length, w is the window size of SkipGram model, d represents the dimension of node representation, and α denotes the ratio of learning data available. To preserve local structural property, we fix the number of walks, the walk length, and the window size, which are set as the default values. The
default values of γ, t, and w are 10, 40, and 5, respectively. The other two parameters are considered from the following combinations: {32, 64, 128} for d and {0.01, 0.05, 0.09} for α, which are the same as previous works [31,35]. Then we perform leave-one-out cross validation on two datasets (i.e., CircR2Disease and circRNADisease) to investigate the impact of these two parameters on the performance of DWNCPCDA. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the influence of varying the dimension and learning ratio to our model on CircR2Disease dataset, from which we can see that the performance has a small fluctuation for the change of α. On the other hand, the AUC scores improve as d increases and become relatively stable at d = 128. The results on circRNADisease dataset are shown in Fig. 2(b), which reveals that the AUC values almost have no change for the change of d and the predictive performance has a small fluctuation for the change of α. The prediction accuracy of DWNCPCDA on above two datasets is at a solid level, and the difference between the maximal and minimal AUC is 2.44% on two datasets, which shows the robustness of our method.
3.3. Comparison with other methods
In order to illustrate the predictive ability of DWNCPCDA, the performance of the proposed method is compared with several prevalent predictors, including NCPCDA [28], CD-LNLP [25], DWNN-RLS [22], KATZHCDA [21], and PWCDA [20]. All of the 6 predictors are trained based on known disease-circRNA interactions downloaded from CircR2Disease database by using five-fold cross validation and leaveone-out cross validation. As shown in Fig. 3, DWNCPCDA performs best among all 6 predictors in leave-one-out cross validation, achieving an AUC of 0.9647, while the AUCs of NCPCDA, CD-LNLP, DWNN-RLS, KATZHCDA, and PWCDA are 0.9541, 0.9012, 0.9180, 0.8672, and 0.9000, respectively. The comparison of ROC curves among the methods considered here in terms of five-fold cross validation is shown in Fig. 4. As a result, the average AUC of DWNCPCDA is up to 0.9599, which is obviously better than that of the others (NCPCDA: 0.9201; CD-LNLP: 0.7996; DWNN-RLS: 0.6503; KATZHCDA: 0.8632; PWCDA: 0.8900;). Furthermore, we capitalize on the paired t-test to detect the differences between DWNCPCDA and the other five models, and the results in Table 1 show the superiority of the proposed method statistically. Meanwhile, we conduct the experiment by using all known associated pairs in our benchmark dataset as the training samples to count the percentage of correctly identified known circRNAs for each disease in various top rankings. Fig. 5 displays that DWNCPCDA can detect more true interactions than other computational models in the top 5, top 10,

top 15, top 20, top 25, and top 30 predictions. For instance, among the 650 known associated pairs, there are 602 (or 92.62%) true positives successfully retrieved in the top 30 ranking for each disease by DWNCPCDA. These six predictors are all network-based methods, which focus on constructing disease and/or circRNA similarity networks. NCPCDA, DWNN-RLS, KATZHCDA, and PWCDA fuse additional information sources to overcome the incompleteness and sparseness of current disease-circRNA association datasets. NCPCDA performs better because it is also based on network consistency projection, which has the advantage of simplicity and effectiveness on the disease and/or circRNA similarity networks. To further demonstrate the advantage of DeepWalk-based similarity measure, we implement another classic topology similarity measure in our circRNA-disease association network,
which is Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel, and then assemble the similarity measure with network consistency projection association discovery model. We compare it with the DeepWalk-based results. As shown in Fig. 6, the model using DeepWalk consistently outperforms the model using GIP kernel in both validations. In summary, all the above results indicate that both a reasonable similarity metric for diseases and circRNAs and effective association prediction model for excavating latent disease-circRNA relationships is pivotal to improve prediction accuracy.
3.4. Case studies
As discussed in the Datasets section, we select the circRNADisease dataset as training samples for case studies, and then verify our findings in CircR2Disease. Furthermore, the predicted potential disease-circRNA relationships are confirmed by searching literatures on PubMed. Here, we analyze the top 30 candidate circRNAs for hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer yielded by DWNCPCDA, and list the rank of those novel verified associations in Table 2, from which we can see the following: (1) CircRNAs hsa_circ_0067934 and hsa_circ_0072088 are observed to be associated with above two investigated cancers, suggesting that these two circRNAs may function as novel diagnostic biomarkers for cancers. (2) There are eight circRNAs supported to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and seven circRNAs validated to be correlated with lung cancer among the top 30 prioritized candidates, respectively. For example, compared with the non-tumorous tissues, the expression levels of hsa_circ_0067934, hsa_circ_0002768, hsa_circ_0072088, hsa_circ_0005273, circMYLK, hsa_circ_0003221, hsa_circ_0003028, and hsa_circ_0007915 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues are all shown to be markedly up-regulated [39–42], which suggest that these eigth circRNAs might be promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with this cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma tissues, Qiu et al. [43] reported that hsa_circ_0067934 is overexpressed and is crucial for lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis. (3) The hsa_circRNA_104912 ranked at top 29 in lung cancer is the fifteenth ranked circRNA by NCPCDA, which indirectly demonstrates that it is probably involved in lung neoplasms. The case studies further suggest that DWNCPCDA can provide valuable candidate circRNAs for drug development. The circRNA candidates for each disease ranked by DWNCPCDA are provided (shown in Supplementary Table S1). However, there are still many candidate circRNAs whose molecular mechanism has not been unveiled. They may also be validated by using biological experiments in the future.

4. Conclusions
There is growing evidence that circRNAs are becoming new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this work, a novel computational method is proposed to recommend circRNA molecules for queried diseases, in which based on the network topological similarity obtained from DeepWalk. The resulting similarity data is further adopted as the input to the network consistency projection method to uncover unknown circRNA-disease interactions. Different from existing computational predictors which primarily make use of additional biological information the circRNAs and diseases have, DWNCPCDA extract the embeddings of vertices including diseases and circRNAs from the disease-circRNA association network to construct the prediction model. The comparative experiments reveal that DWNCPCDA has better performance than those models using biological features and models using other topological similarity. Moreover, DWNCPCDA illustrates the good prediction ability in the case study. In future research, more biomedical linked data of circRNAs or diseases, like circRNA- miRNA associations and disease-miRNA associations, could be integrated for similarity learning, which may further boost the performance. In addition, DWNCPCDA assembles the similarity-based solution with the network consistency projection algorithm for circRNA-disease prediction. In fact, network consistency projection can be replaced by certain machine learning techniques based
vectorial data, which may get more accurate prediction overall.
