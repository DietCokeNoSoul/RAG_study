Abstract
Motivation: CircRNAs play a critical regulatory role in physiological processes, and the abnormal expression of circRNAs can mediate the processes of diseases. Therefore, exploring circRNAs–disease associations is gradually becoming an important area of research. Due to the high cost of validating circRNA–disease associations using traditional wet-lab experiments, novel computational methods based on machine learning are gaining more and more attention in this field. However, current computational methods suffer to insufficient consideration of latent features in circRNA–disease interactions.
Results: In this study, a multilayer attention neural graph-based collaborative filtering (MLNGCF) is proposed. MLNGCF first enhances multiple biological information with autoencoder as the initial features of circRNAs and diseases. Then, by constructing a central network of different diseases and circRNAs, a multilayer cooperative attention-based message propagation is performed on the central network to obtain the high-order features of circRNAs and diseases. A neural network-based collaborative filtering is constructed to predict the unknown circRNA–disease associations and update the model parameters. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that MLNGCF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the prediction results are supported by the literature in the case studies.
Availability and implementation: The source codes and benchmark datasets of MLNGCF are available at https://github.com/ABard0/ MLNGCF.
1 Introduction
With the development of sequencing technology and bioinformatics, circRNA have been discovered abundant in eukaryotic cells (Holdt et al. 2018, Wesselhoeft et al. 2018) with increasing diversity. For example, circRNA_100395 acts as a microRNA sponge in breast cancer pathogenesis to suppress overexpression of the gene MAPK6 (Yu et al. 2020), inhibiting the proliferation and expansion of breast cancer cells. There is increasing evidence showing that the circRNAs are associated with many diseases, and thus it was extensively recognized as a biomarker for predicting diseases (Vuolteenaho et al. 2005, Li et al. 2015) with therapeutic effects (Lei et al. 2019, Verduci et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2022). In recent years, a number of related databases are established for circRNAs, diseases, and circRNA–disease associations. The databases about circRNA are CircNet (Chen et al. 2022), deepBase (Yang et al. 2010), circBase (Glazar et al. 2014), etc. The databases about diseases are Mesh (Mottaz et al. 2008), and MalaCards (Rappaport et al. 2013), etc. The databases about the circRNA–disease associations between
circRNA and diseases are circR2Disease (Fan et al. 2022), circ2Disease (Yao et al. 2018) and circRNADisease (Zhao et al. 2018).
Although the above high-quality databases of circRNA–disease associations have been developed, a large number of circRNAdisease associations still unknown. With the rapid development of machine learning methods (Chen et al. 2022), the usage of these techniques to predict unknown circRNA–disease associations has become a popular topic. These methods can be broadly divided into two groups. The first group of methods pays more attention to enriching the input embeddings. For example, Wang et al. proposed the IMS-CDA (Wang et al. 2020), which combined the disease semantic similarity, disease Jaccard similarity, Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and circRNA similarity information to extract the hidden features using Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE). Wei et al. proposed iCircDA-MF (Wei and Liu, 2020) to introduce gene information into the limited size of the training data and construct the circRNA–gene–disease relation network to expand the data sources, this model used matrix factorization and completion techniques to reduce the feature noise.

Chen et al. proposed RGCNCDA (Chen et al. 2022), in which a circRNA–miRNA–disease global heterogeneous network is first constructed by integrating three biological entity networks based on relational convolutional networks (R-GCNs). The second group of methods pays more attention to feature extraction. For example, Wang et al. proposed the GCNCDA (Wang et al. 2020) by introducing FastGCN for fast extraction of high-order features and using Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) classifier for making a prediction. Zheng et al. proposed the ICDA-CGR (Zheng et al. 2020), which introduced circRNA sequence information and quantified the nonlinear relationship in circRNA sequences by Chaos Game Representation (CGR) based on the sequence position information. The SIMCCDA (Li et al. 2020) propose matrix completion to predict the associations between circRNAs and diseases by Speedup Inductive Matrix Completion (SIMC). Niu et al. proposed the GMNN2CD (Niu et al. 2022), which employed a graph Markov convolutional neural network to score the potential circRNA–disease associations by integrating a graph autoencoder and variational inference. Bian et al. proposed the GATCDA (Bian et al. 2021) model, which utilized a graph attention network (GAT) to predict circRNA–disease associations with disease symptom similarity, network similarity, and information entropy similarity for both circRNAs and diseases. Zhao et al. proposed the IBNPKATZ (Zhao et al. 2019), which integrated the bipartite network projection algorithm and KATZ measure to achieves reliable prediction. Ge et al. proposed LLCDC (Ge et al. 2020), which reconstructed similarity networks using Locality-Constrained Linear Coding (LLC) on the known association matrix. Furthermore, some state-of-the-art computational models and publicly accessible databases are summarized by Wang et al. (2021). However, the above mentioned methods still have some limitations. The first group of methods focuses too much on
the construction of circRNAs and disease similarity and ignores the connection and collaborative signals hidden in the circRNA–disease networks. The second group of methods is difficult to distill the desired collaborative signals in the circRNA–disease network (Wang et al. 2019). To solve the challenges discussed above, we propose a graph collaborative filtering method MLNGCF based on multilayer attention and collaborative filtering. MLNGCF refines the similarity information as initial features of nodes on the central network and proposes a new message propagation network with a multilayer cooperative attention mechanism. In this network, the first-order connectivity model is expanded by stacking more message propagation layers to explore high-order connectivity messages. In addition, a multilayer cooperative attention mechanism is introduced to further weigh the messages propagated at different layers. Finally, a collaborative filtering model is used for the prediction of circRNA–disease associations. Five-fold cross-validation results on the benchmark datasets show that MLNGCF performs better than existing methods, and the prediction results from case studies are also supported by the literature.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 The framework of the proposed model MLNGCF
The framework of the proposed MLNGCF is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the semantic similarity of diseases, the functional similarity of circRNAs, the GIP kernel similarity of circRNAs, and the GIP kernel similarity of diseases are calculated and refined as the initial embeddings of circRNAs and diseases. Second, the initial embeddings are propagated with multilayer cooperative attention on the circRNA–disease adjacency matrix to generate higher-order embeddings of circRNAs and diseases. Finally, circRNA–disease associations are predicted by a
Figure 1. The framework of the proposed MLNGCF. It can be divided into three parts. In part A, uniform representations of circRNAs and disease are obtained after feature preprocessing and a circRNA–disease lookup table is constructed. In part B, a message propagation with cooperative attention mechanism is proposed to optimize the representations of circRNAs and disease. In part C, a neural collaborative filtering predictor is constructed for making prediction. The part B and part C are displayed in the form of node to node for easy understanding.

collaborative filtering model to approximate the initial circRNA–disease adjacency matrix as closely as possible.
2.2 Benchmark datasets
In this article, we collect three public databases (circR2Disease, circ2Disease, and circRNADisease) as a unified dataset of circRNA–disease associations to measure the model performance. CircR2Disease is a collection of numerous experimentally validated circRNA–disease associations, which contains a total of 739 circRNA–disease associations between 661 circRNAs and 100 diseases. After removing redundant data, we obtain 650 circRNA–disease pairs between 585 circRNAs and 88 diseases. Similarly, the circ2Disease database contains a total of 270 circRNA–disease associations between 249 circRNAs and 60 diseases. circRNADisease database contains a total of 350 circRNA–disease associations between 330 circRNAs and 48 diseases. In this article, the strategy of Wang et al. (2020) is used to construct the negative samples, we construct the final dataset with the same number of positive samples and negative samples. We also use the PubMed (Canese and Weis 2013) medical literature database and Mesh database for diseases. The Mesh database is a database of disease relationships deposited in the form of directed acyclic graphs. The PubMed database comprises more than 35 million citations for biomedical literature. Based on the CircR2Disease, circ2Disease and circRNADisease databases, we construct the circRNA–diseases adjacency matrix, which has the size of N M, corresponding to N circRNAs and M diseases, respectively. If a circRNA is related to a disease, the value in the corresponding adjacency matrix is 1, otherwise 0.
2.3 Similarity construction
After obtaining the adjacency matrix, four similarity matrices are calculated, they are disease semantic similarity matrix; disease GIP kernel similarity matrix; circRNA functional similarity matrix; and circRNA GIP kernel similarity matrix. The details for the construction of the above similarity matrices are described in Supplementary Parts SA–SD. In order to facilitate the embedding construction, the features of circRNAs and diseases are fused to form the initial descriptor. The descriptor not only reveals the associations between circRNAs and diseases but also represents the hidden connections between circRNAs and diseases. Here, we use a new disease descriptor defined in Niu et al. (2022) and Wang et al. (2020). If there is a semantic similarity association between two diseases dðiÞ and dðjÞ, then the disease similarity descriptor DSim dðiÞ; dðjÞ is defined as the semantic similarity between the two diseases; otherwise, it is defined as the GIP kernel similarity of diseases. The detailed calculation is as follows:
DSim cðiÞ; cðjÞ 1⁄4 SD dðiÞ; dðjÞ if dðiÞ and dðjÞ has semantic similarity
DGS dðiÞ; dðjÞ otherwise
(
(1)
where SD dðiÞ; dðjÞ and DGS dðiÞ; dðjÞ represent semantic similarity and GIP kernel similarity of disease i and disease j. Similarly, the functional similarity of circRNAs and GIP kernel similarity constructed for circRNAs are used to form new circRNA similarity descriptor CSimðcðiÞ; cðjÞÞ:
CSim cðiÞ; cðjÞ 1⁄4 FC cðiÞ; cðjÞ if cðiÞ and cðjÞ has functional similarity
CGS cðiÞ; cðjÞ otherwise
(
(2)
where FC cðiÞ; cðjÞ and CGS cðiÞ; cðjÞ represent functional similarity and GIP kernel similarity of circRNA i and circRNA j.
2.4 Feature preprocessing
Deep autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network that projects data from a high dimension to a low dimension (Chicco et al. 2014, Tan et al. 2016). In this study, a deep autoencoder is proposed to generate a uniform representation of circRNAs and diseases. For the similarity construction, the descriptor of circRNAs CSim and the descriptor of related diseases DSim are obtained. Take similarity features of diseases as an example, the encoding operation of the autoencoder can be expressed as:
Ds 1⁄4 L w DSim þ b
ð Þ (3)
where
LðxÞ 1⁄4 1
1 þ exp ð xÞ (4)
where w and b are the weight and bias, respectively. After obtaining the embedding Ds, the decoding operation of the autoencoder is constructed using a similar approach:
DSim0 1⁄4 L 1⁄4 w0 Ds þ b0
ð Þ (5)
where DSim0 represents the descriptor of diseases after autoencoder refactoring. w0 and b0 denotes the weight and bias of the decoding operator, respectively. In order to obtain the high-level features of diseases, this operation will stop until DSim0 is approximately equal to DSim. Then, the learned embedding Ds 2 RM k is used as the new disease similarity feature matrix, where k denotes the feature dimension and it is set as 128 in this article. Similarly, the embedding of circRNAs can also be obtained in the same way.
2.5 Message propagation with multilayer cooperative attention mechanism
In order to capture the hidden collaborative signals in a graph structure, we established a GNN-based message propagation mechanism based on the model proposed by Wang et al. (Wang et al. 2019, Sun et al. 2022). To further enhance the discriminability of the learned embeddings, we propose a single-layer message propagation mechanism on the central network. In addition, a multilayer cooperative attention mechanism is added to optimize the embedding process in the multilayer message propagation to coordinate the weights among different layers.
2.5.1 Embedding lookup table construction
After the autoencoder reconstruction, the initial feature matrix of circRNAs Cs and the initial feature matrix of diseases Ds are obtained. We denote ec 2 Rk, ed 2 Rk as the column of circRNA feature matrix Cs and disease feature matrix Ds,

respectively. Then, an embedding lookup table can be constructed as follows:
E 1⁄4 ec1 ; . . . ; ecN ; ed1 ; . . . ; edM
1⁄2 2 R NþM
ð Þ k (6)
where N is the number of different circRNAs, M is the number of different diseases. Then, we set this embedding lookup table as the input of the training model in message propagation. Different from traditional matrix factorization, the embeddings of circRNA and disease are refined by propagating over the circRNA–disease association network. Since the association network can fully incorporate collaborative signals when compared with matrix factorizationbased methods, the more discriminable embeddings of circRNAs and diseases can be obtained in the proposed method.
2.5.2 Single-layer message propagation
In traditional recommendation systems, the user who buys an item can be considered as a feature of that item, this feature can be used to measure the similarity between two items (Ko et al. 2022), since the interaction between the item and the user directly indicates the user’s preferences. Similarly, this approach is also applicable to measure the associations of circRNAs and diseases. Thus, a mechanism is established for message propagation between circRNAs and diseases by dividing it into two main processes: message construction and message aggregation.
(a): message construction
Given a circRNA–disease pair ðc; dÞ in circRNA–disease association network, a message propagation mechanism from c to d can be established as follows:
md c 1⁄4 f ec; ed; pdc
ð Þ (7)
where md c is the message (embeddings to be propagated) passed from c to d. f ð Þ denotes the encoding function of the message, which takes embeddings ec and ed as input. pdc is the coefficient factor to control the decay rate in this process. Equation (7) can be further expressed as follows:
md c 1⁄4 1
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
Nd
j jþ Nc
jj
p W1ec þ W2 ec ed
ð Þ (8)
where 1= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
Nd
j jþ Nc
jj
p (equals to pdc) is the graph Laplacian norm with N c and N d, denoting the first-hop neighbors of circRNA c and disease d. It can be interpreted as a discount factor because the messages being propagated should decay with
the path length. W1 2 Rk0 k and W2 2 Rk0 k are trainable weight matrices to extract useful messages in the propagation process. k0 is the size of messages after transformation. In Equation (9), not only the contribution of node ec can be considered but also the correlation between ec and ed can be enhanced through ec ed, which creates a dependence between ec and ed in message propagation.
(b): message aggregation
In message construction, the propagated messages on the circRNA–disease path are constructed. Take the central network of disease as an example, the messages passed from the neighboring nodes of a disease are aggregated and refined to
form the embedding representations. The aggregation function is defined as:
eð1Þ
d 1⁄4 LeakyReLU md d þ X
c2N d
md c (9)
where eð1Þ
d denotes the embeddings of disease d obtained after the first message propagation, md d 1⁄4 W1ed, md c 1⁄4 W1ec: W1 is the same as W1 in Equation (8). Similarly, the aggregation function eð1Þ
c for the circRNA can be built by the disease nodes in the central network of circRNA c. Equation (9) not only considers the messages propagated from neighboring nodes N d to disease d but also the connection of disease d itself.
2.5.3 Multilayer message propagation
Based on the above single-layer (single-order) message propagation, more message propagation layers can be stacked to explore higher-order connectivity information, and this higher-order connectivity signal can be used to measure the correlation between circRNAs and diseases. In this article, as shown in Fig. 2, by stacking l message propagation layers, the central disease or circRNA is able to receive messages from llayer neighboring nodes. When propagating to layer l, the embedding of disease d can be formulated as:
eðlÞ
d 1⁄4 LeakyReLU mðlÞ
d dþ X c2N d
mðlÞ
dc
!
(10)
where the messages propagated are defined as follows:

(11)
where WðlÞ
1 ; WðlÞ
2 2 Rkl kl 1 are trainable transformation ma
trices, klis the size of messages after transformation. eðl 1Þ
c represents the embeddings after ðl 1Þ times message propagation. Analogously, the embeddings of related diseases can also be obtained by applying the same mechanism of message propagation. The detailed process is shown in Fig. 2. In addition, during message propagation, different neighbors may contribute differently to the central node. In this article, a multilayer collaborative attention mechanism is introduced to capture the contribution values of different neighbors before message aggregation and update the representations of the central nodes.
2.5.4 Multilayer cooperative attention mechanism on message propagation
For a central node, the embeddings of neighbors are first calculated, and then the embeddings of a central node are reconstructed after message propagation. It is worth noting that during the process, the message weights of different nodes in the same layer are identical, controlled by pdc. which cannot capture the contributions of different nodes in the same layer. Therefore, the GAT model (Velickovic et al. 2017) is used to learn the weights of different nodes in the same layer. However, GAT ignores the dependency between different attention heads. To this end, we propose multilayer cooperative

attention, which allows different attention heads to be distributed in different message layers to establish their relationship. The detailed process is shown in Fig. 3. First, the attention score of circRNA and disease is calculated based on the message propagation:

The network transforms the input into the embeddings of
circRNAs and diseases. eðl 1Þ
d and eðl 1Þ
c denotes the embedding of disease and circRNA in the l-th layer, respectively. Then, the attention scores are normalized by the following process:
aðlÞ

P
t2N d exp LeakyReLU qðlÞ
dt
(13)
where N d represents the neighbors of the central node of disease d in the l-th layer. aðlÞ
dc is the contribution value of circRNA c to disease d during message propagation. The linear combination of the central network is used to update the embedding of disease d:
eðlÞ
d 1⁄4 LeakyReLU mðlÞ
d dþ X c2N d
aðlÞ
dc mðlÞ
dc
!
(14)
where LeakyReLU represents activation function, aðlÞ
dc denotes
the attention scores of neighbors in central networks of disease d. According to Equation (13), the attention mechanism on the central network can be implemented in the process of message propagation at each layer. Therefore, each propagation layer corresponds to an attention head, and as the number of layers increases, richer representational information can be learned. This mechanism of message propagation between different layers builds the dependency in different attention heads. After obtaining the weighted embeddings of circRNAs and diseases, the hierarchical propagation rule is proposed:
EðlÞ 1⁄4 LeakyReLU Eðl 1ÞWl1 þ hðl 1ÞLEðl 1ÞWl1 þ hðl 1ÞLEðl 1Þ Eðl 1ÞWl2

2.6 Collaborative filtering for model prediction
Based on the above processes, the multiple representations

and eð1Þ

for circRNAs and diseases are obtained. Since the embeddings propagated from different
layers do not contain the same content and the contributions are different. Referring to Wang’s method (Wang et al. 2019), the embeddings of different layers are concatenated to form the final representations of circRNAs and diseases:
eðc Þ 1⁄4 eð1Þ
c k . . . keðlÞ
c
eð Þ
d 1⁄4 eð1Þ
d k . . . keðlÞ
d
# (17)
Thus, the final embeddings of circRNAs and diseases are obtained. In order to fully utilize the embeddings to calculate the association scores between circRNAs and diseases (He et al. 2017), a neural collaborative filtering is proposed to predict the associations between circRNAs and diseases. In the collaborative filtering network, matrix factorization (MF) (Koren et al. 2009, Li et al. 2020) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) (Ramchoun et al. 2016) are introduced as an instance of interaction function to infer the potential associations between circRNAs and diseases. Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF) (Lee and Seung 2000, Shan and Banerjee 2010, Ma and Liu 2022) is widely used in collaborative filtering for recommendation. Generally, the input of the model is a one-hot encoded representation, which is fed into one fully connected layer to generate the dense vector of circRNAs or diseases. The first mapping layer of the GMF is defined as follows:
Egmf eðc Þ; eð Þ
d 1⁄4 eðc Þ eð Þ
d (18)
where denotes the element-wise product of vectors. To take the nonlinear relationship between circRNAs and diseases into consideration, a standard MLP is introduced to learn the interactions of latent features and improve the nonlinear modeling capabilities. The neural collaborative filtering is defined as follows:
Emlp 1⁄4 aL WLT aL 1 . . . a1 W1T
eðc Þ
eð Þ
d
"#
þ b1
!
...
!!
þ bL
!
(19)
where Wi; ai; biði 2 1; 2; . . . LÞ denote the weight matrix, ReLU activation function, and bias of the layer i, respectively. GMF applies a linear kernel to model the latent features, and MLP uses a non-linear kernel to learn the interaction function from data. In order to make the prediction model with both linear and nonlinear learning capabilities, GMF with a one-layer MLP is used as follows:
y0 1⁄4 sum hT Egmf
Emlp
(20)
where Egmf and Emlp denote the outputs of eðc Þ and eð Þ
d after
matrix decomposition and MLP operation, respectively. h denotes the connection weights of matrix factorization and MLP. Here, the sum of vector elements instead of activation functions is used for mapping. The detailed process of collaborative filtering is shown in Fig. 4.
2.7 Parameter optimization of MLNGCF
Based on the hypothesis that confirmed circRNA–disease pairs reflect the associations between circRNAs and diseases,
6 Wu et al.
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/8/btad499/7240485 by guest on 31 August 2024


MLNGCF assigns a high score to confirmed circRNA–disease pairs and a low score to unknown circRNA–disease pairs. The optimized objective function is defined as follows:
Loss 1⁄4 P
c;i;j
ð Þ2S lnr y0
ci y0
cj þ kjjHjj2
2 (21)
where S 1⁄4 ðc; i; jÞjðc; iÞ 2 Sþ; ðc; jÞ 2 S denotes the paired training data. Sþand S denote the confirmed circRNA–disease associations and unknown circRNA–disease pairs, respectively. i and j represent two disease belongs to Sþand S , respectively. r denotes the activation function. H denotes the trainable parameters. k is the regularization parameter. Specifically, Adam is used as the optimizer for model training.
3 Results
3.1 Evaluation metrics
In this study, a 5-fold cross-validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of the prediction method MLNGCF. All known circRNA–disease associations are evenly divided into k subsets, where each subset takes turn to be the test set, while the other subsets are used as the training set. In this study, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), and accuracy are used as the performance metrics. In addition, F1-score and NDCG (Wang et al. 2013) are used. The details of each metric are described in Supplementary Part SF.
3.2 Performance of MLNGCF on circR2Disease
As 5-fold cross-validation approach is used for evaluating the performance of MLNGCF, which produces the final results in an averaged manner. The ROC curves and the precision–recall curves obtained for each fold in the experiments are shown in Fig. 5. The rest of the metrics are given in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, It can be seen that the proposed method MLNGCF achieves promising results. The key metrics AUC is 98.54% and AUPR is 72.49%. However, it can also observe that the model still yields fluctuations in F1scores and AUPR for different folds, which may be caused by the limited available data.
Furthermore, the loss curve is drawn to verify the convergence of the proposed model under circR2Disease database in Fig. 6. It can be seen that proposed model can converge after 750 iterations.
3.3 Comparison with state-of-the-art methods
To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model MLNGCF, we compare it with existing representative methods on the circR2Disease database. The compared methods are RGCNCDA (Chen et al. 2022), GCNCDA (Wang et al. 2020), GMNN2CD (Niu et al. 2022), iCircDA-MF (Wei and Liu 2020), IMS-CDA (Wang et al. 2020), and ICDA-CGR (Zheng et al. 2020). Since the evaluation metrics adopted by different methods are different, the main evaluation metric AUC is chosen here for comparison, and the results are given in Table 2. It should be noted that although the methods under the comparison are all evaluated on the circRNA–disease associations from the circR2Disease database, the data that they used are not completely the same. For example, iCircDAMF uses only human data, while GCNCDA used both human data and the data from other species.
3.4 Performance on circ2Disease and circRNADisease
To demonstrate the robustness of MLNGCF, we also evaluate it on Circ2Disease and CircRNADisease databases, the results are given in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 7, ROC curves are drawn for the experimental results on two databases, and their AUCs are calculated. The results on Circ2Disease and CircRNADisease show that MLCNGCF achieves good performance on the two databases, the AUCs are both higher than 0.9. In addition, the metrics reach similar levels to the performance on the CircR2Disease database, which confirms that our method MLNGCF can be applied to benchmark datasets from different data sources.

construction. In MLNGCF, this look-up table is updated by the initial circRNA–disease similarity features. To verify the effectiveness of the look-up table used in MLNGCF, we removed the initial circRNA–disease similarity matrix and replaced it with randomly initialized features as a variant method. The ROC results are shown in Fig. 8, we can see that the AUC of the variant model decreases from 98.54%
to 96.06%. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of the similarity matrix as initial lookup tables in MLNGCF.
3.6 Effectiveness of multilayer cooperative attention in MLNGCF
In order to verify the effectiveness of the multilayer cooperative attention mechanism, we compare MLNGCF with the variant method that removes the multilayer cooperative attention mechanism. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Compared with the original MLCNGCF model (Fig. 5), the AUC and AUPR decreases significantly after removing multilayer cooperative attention heads, where the AUC decreases from 98.54% to 94.87%. The results indicate that multilayer cooperative attention plays an important role in the message propagation process.

collaborative filtering. Other aggregators such as weighted summation, maximum pooling, LSTM can also be used. In order to verify the most suitable aggregators for MLNGCF, we compare these aggregators in the same configuration and compare the AUCs. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 10. We can see that the MLCNGCF model using concatenation as the aggregator achieves the best AUCs, followed by the maximum pooling, and LSTM.
3.8 Number of cooperative attention layers in MLNGCF
For multilayer message propagation, we use three message layers for message propagation and cooperation between
multilayer attention heads. Here, we verify that the optimal number of layers is three. On the CircR2Disease database, the samples are randomly divided into five independent subsets and labeled as Subset 1, Subset 2, Subset 3, Subset 4, and Subset 5 for testing the performance of different numbers of message layers. As shown in Fig. 11, for each sample, the same experimental settings are used from a single message layer to five message layers. As can be seen in the five figures with different message layers, MLNGCF with a single message layer performs the worst, as the number of message layers increases, the model prediction performance shows an increasing trend. We also see that the performance of the model tends to stabilize when the number of message layers is 3. Thus, it can be concluded that

MLNGCF with the three message layers and the corresponding multilayer attention mechanism yields the best results.
3.9 Case study
To demonstrate the prediction ability of the MLNGCF model, 50,830 unknown associations between 585 circRNAs and 88 diseases are scored by MLNGCF. Here, we search the PubMed database for evidence to support the experimental results. The top 10 circRNAs associated with breast cancer (BC) (Li et al. 2019) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Fu et al. 2018) are listed in Tables 4 and 5. The PMIDs of the support literature are given. For breast cancer, the top candidate hsa_circ_0001946 is experimentally verified by coexpression analysis in early-stage breast cancer tissues (Rao et al. 2021).
The top 10 circRNA–disease pairs are also given in descending order based on prediction scores, and the results are shown in Table 6.
4 Discussion and conclusion
In this study, we propose n novel prediction model MLNGCF, which is a multilayer attention neural graphbased collaborative filtering model for inferring potential circRNA–disease associations. MLNGCF first fuses the similarity information of circRNAs and diseases to construct unified descriptors and refines it by deep auto encoder (DAE). Then, message propagation mechanism is used to exploit key collaborative signals in the adjacency matrix. Attention heads are also constructed at different message layers, and more

information can be transmitted during message propagation. In addition, an interaction function of collaborative filtering is introduced to integrate both matrix factorization and MLP and score circRNAs–disease associations. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and reliability of MLNGCF. However, there are still some limitations that need to be further exploited in the future. On the one hand, the limitation of poorly annotated data affects the generalization ability of the proposed method. On the other hand, the proposed method cannot be applied to new circRNAs and new diseases, because the circRNAs and diseases need be in the network. In the next step, we expect to combine more representative databases and construct more advanced algorithms for similarity calculation, such as novel sequencing techniques and heterogeneous networks of circRNAs and diseases. Considering that MLNGCF treats circRNA–disease pairs with unknown associations as the negative samples, this strategy may result in deviations of the training process. Positive-unlabeled learning which builds a classifier with only positive and unlabeled examples can be introduced.
