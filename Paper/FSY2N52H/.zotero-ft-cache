ABSTRACT
Production logistics (PL) is increasingly receiving attention from supply chain research. The spatial disorder and temporal asynchrony of the PL resources due to the uncertainty and dynamicity pose great challenges to efficient resource allocation. The inability to obtain and rational use of PL resource spatial–temporal values causes unnecessary long travelling distances and excessive waiting time, which impede the sustainable performance of PL operations. In response, this research proposes a PL resource allocation approach based on the dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph (DSTKG). Internet of Things(IoT) signals data generated from large-scale deployed IoT devices are investigated and analysed to spatial–temporal values through deep neural networks. The DSTKG model is established for representing the digital twin replica with spatial–temporal consistency, followed by reasoning and completion of relationships based on PL task information. The PL resources are allocated efficiently through the graph algorithm from the directed and weighted graph. The case study is conducted to verify the feasibility and practicality of the proposed solution based on large-scale deployment. Finally, the result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
1. Introduction
The concept of Industry 4.0 is now driving new industrial revolution, and the strategy of accelerating the manufacturing industry towards digitalization, networking, and intelligence has been supported by many organizations and governments. Under the goal of the unmanned factory, some large manufacturing company has initially realized “smart factory” to some extent through upgrading equipment, and the production efficiencys has been significantly improved. However, the realization of a smart factory is a step-by-step development. The upgrading of equipment and production lines involves substantial capital investment. The intelligence level of a factory often equates to the economic capacity of the manufacturing enterprise. After the stepped development reaches a certain level, it will inevitably bring about a period of stagnation. Currently, the scope of industry 4.0 research and application is improving from “automated execution of partial production stages” to “intelligent operation of the entire production process”. During production operations, no matter what level of intelligence the
factory is currelty in, when the material goes on the production line, the improvement of its efficiency is already limited since the operation plan and control parameters are fixed. Production logistics (PL) links upstream and downstream from manufacturing to transportation to warehousing through the transfer of materials in different units. It is claimed to occupy 95% of the total production time and determines the efficiency of the entire production process (Z. Guo et al., 2020; T. Qu et al., 2016). Therefore, within the scope of economic capacity, the efficient operation of PL has become a new research focus. PL is often subject to high operational dynamics due to large working areas, frequent resource interactions, long operation periods, and intensive human involvement (Ting Qu et al., 2017). PL resources refer to physical resources such as personnel, vehicles, and material that are related to the execution of the PL operations (W. Yang et al., 2020). The PL resources have manifested the following two characteristics during the execution of PL operations. (1). Spatial disorder: PL resources flow in and out of different production/storage buffers frequently according to PL task requirements. It is usually difficult to estimate the location of PL

resources and monitor their availability due to the high mobility and randomness. Some PL tasks that can be completed within easy reach are often assigned to PL resources far away (2). Temporal asynchrony: Before the production, the logistics buffer area needs to wait for all the necessary tools, materials, and personnel “in place” can they be started in production. Excessive waiting time not only reduces the throughput but also increases energy consumption as some machines must be powered on in advance for preheating or other necessary operations. After the production, many materials/work-in-process (M/WIP) buffers have to be built to hedge against time risk by increasing space, which causes chaos, and frequent accidents. These two characteristics cause difficulties to efficient PL resource allocation. Unnecessary long travelling distances and excessive waiting time pose great challenges to sustainable PL operation performance. In recent years, the digital twin, as the most basic and key technology to realize the cyber-physical system, has been widely used to solve the problem of the integration of the cyber space and the physical space. A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical entity, the virtual replica can be monitored through precise mapping of physical resources. The Internet of Things (IoT) is employed as enabling technology to construct the information fundamentals of precise monitoring and simulation through sensing and transferring the data from physical assets (D. Hofmann & Branding, 2019; Guo et al., 2020). In terms of digital twin modelling, the geometric, physical, rule, and behavioural modelling tools reproduce the physical models (Qi et al., 2021). However, there are still few applicable spatial–temporal modelling of the physical entity. The knowledge graph technology, which can realize the formal description of things in the physical world and their relationships, shows an explosive upward trend. Many researchers start to model the manufacturing resources to the knowledge graph to describe relationships and infer the implicit information through mining the unstructured text (D. Zhang et al., 2021). Great progress has been made in solving task allocation, path planning, and comprehensive scheduling targeting at the manufacturing resources in the production stage (Li et al., 2020; B. Yang et al., 2021). A knowledge graph-based optimization approach is proposed for resource allocation by integrating the complex data of workshop resources and mining the implicit semantic information (Zhou et al., 2021). Given all that, the research and application of digital twin have drawn extensive attention, but there are still challenges in production logistics. The overwhelming amount of data generated from IoT sensors in the factory implies spatial–temporal value but also poses challenges to sustainable performance if underutilized. The first challenge is how to covert the massive and heterogeneous IoT data to comprehensible spatial–temporal information. Current digital twin modelling research mainly focus on specific objects or working tasks by reflecting the characteristics of the individual’s internal geometry, behavior, and rules. In contrast to manufacturing resources, which are stationary due to large volume and weight, the dynamics of position and status of PL resources are significant during the execution of tasks, but few studies consider the digital twin modelling of spatial–temporal consistency between physical and virtual entities. The second challenge is how to establish digital twin spatial–temporal modelling to accurately represent and visualize the global PL resources. Moreover, the resource allocation for production logistics is still in its infancy. The core of effective resource allocation is to take full consideration of the spatial–temporal dynamics of resources and the close integration with operations. Hence, the third challenge, how to efficiently allocate PL resources by fully considering dynamics and operation coupling relationships in a spatial–temporal perspective, is worthy of in-depth study. To solve the above-mentioned challenges, the objective of this research is to propose a dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph model for PL resource allocation. A deep neural network-based digital twin spatial–temporal mapping method is first proposed, which provides the accurate spatial–temporal values of the PL resources in the largescale deployment. Then, a dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph
model is constructed which provides an intuitive representation of the PL resource’s spatial–temporal values and interrelationships. Graph algorithm-based resource allocation method considering the geospatial distance and time window in a directed and weighted graph is established. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of this solution are validated in a real-life case company. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: related works are reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 proposes the architecture of dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph (DSTKG)-based PL resources allocation with different functional layers. Section 4 introduces the deep learning method for estimating the spatial–temporal values in the complicated environment and the DSTKG modelling and resource allocation approach. Section 6 evaluates the performance of the solution in a collaborating industrial park where a wide range of PL resources is involved. Conclusions and managerial implications are summarized in the last section.
2. Literature review
Based on the challenges of the problem, we review the most relevant and recent literature on the production logistics resources management, digital twin, and knowledge graph in manufacturing.
2.1. Production logistics resource management
Due to the lack of real-time dynamic perception, the PL system cannot fully control the real-time status of the PL resource, and therefore unable to respond to dynamic disturbances promptly. Poon et al. (2009) use RFID to manage the logistics resources in the warehouse for optimizing order-picking operations, the location of the forklift is calculated through triangular localization scheme where the readers are deployed fixed with the pre-set location. In view of the excessive waiting time and energy consumption of a large number of resources in PL, Y. Zhang et al. (2018) propose a framework depicting the mechanism and methodology of smart PL systems to implement intelligent modelling of key manufacturing resources and investigate self-organizing configuration mechanisms. Considering the uncertainty of material demands time caused by production fluctuation, Huang et al. (2019) establish a mathematical scheduling model with fuzzy time windows to minimize the distribution cost based on the IoT. Fikry et al. (2021) incorporate temporal and spatial variations, multi-period, and industrial constraints into a PL crop rotation planning model for sugar beet supply chains. Li et al. (2020) propose a resource allocation methodology for a PL system, factor experiment is exploited to distinguish bottleneck resources from non-bottleneck resources. A digital twin-driven decision-making information architecture is proposed by Pan et al. (2021), synchronized operation of the multi-stage system is obtained with the help of a parallel synchronization mechanism under the PL background. Z. Zhang and David (2019) develop an operation entropy model of PL system to measure the operational efficiency of PL. Ting Qu et al. (2017) explore the typical PL execution processes and adopts system dynamics to design cost-effective IoT solutions and present a quantitative IoT systems analysis approach. Cao et al. (2019) propose a novel RFID-based logistics information processing approach, this study uses a similarity clustering approach to mine anomalies considering attributes of time, location, quantity, sequence, and path. A real-time scheduling model and algorithm containing logistics factors in job shop are proposed by Cai et al. (2022), they also find a rule that in job shop with a large proportion of logistics transportation time, the method can achieve more competitive results.
2.2. Digital twin
The concept of the digital twin is first proposed by Grieves (2014). The digital twin establishes a dynamic virtual model of physical entities in multi-dimensional, multiple spatial–temporal scales, multiple

disciplines, and multiple physical quantities in a digital way to simulate and describe the attributes, behaviors, and rules of physical entities in the real world (Fei Tao et al., 2018). With the technical development brought by machine learning, IoT, and cloud computing, it has gradually become possible to realize the spatial–temporal consistent mapping from physical space to virtual space, and the digital twins have recently become research hotspots. Five-dimensional model of digital twin, proposed by F. Tao et al., 2018, includes geometric, physical, behaviour, rule, and data. Location, as one of the attributes in geometric modelling of virtual entity, has the nature of dynamics over time. A reference guide of enabling technologies and tools for understanding and implementing five-dimensional digital twin is provided by Qi et al. (2021), authors state that sensing and tracking of physical entities are crucial in the connections of physical entities. A simulation-based decision support tool based on digital twin is proposed by Coelho et al. (2021), real
information, intelligent autonomous vehicles, and a flexible and lively operations environment are taken in to account for designing and planning the in-house logistics operations. Wei et al. (2022) develop the implementation strategy of physical entity for manufacturing system digital twin via integrating the design domain of axiomatic design. The effectiveness of the proposed physical entity for DT is validated through computer numerical control machine cutting tool life prediction. Zhuang et al. (2021) proposed the five-dimensional modelling of shopfloor digital twin to realize 3D visual and real-time monitoring of shop-floor operating status. A digital twin-driven energy-efficient multicrane scheduling is proposed by N. Zhao et al. (2022). The multi-crane system based on simulation was built in a virtual space under digital twin framework. The global positioning system represented by Global Positioning System (GPS) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) can realize real-time positioning in the outdoor environment. Due to

signal penetration and attenuation problems, accurate positioning cannot be achieved indoors (Liu et al., 2020; Z. Zhao et al., 2018). However, for the manufacturing industry, most PL operations are completed in indoor and indoor-outdoor linkage environments. Brenner and Hummel (2017) point out that indoor localization system is needed first for coupling the digital and the real world. Several studies have adopted radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which brought the RFID tag close to the reader to complete the read and write events for identifying the relative process position through passive positioning(Yao et al., 2018). Z. Zhao et al. (2021) adopt IoT indoor tracking system to build digital twin to monitor the safety status of personnel in cold storage. Ruppert and Abonyi (2020) introduce the integration of real-time locating systems into digital twins and highlight the benefits of information fusion with real-time locating systems, the proposed digital twin is continuously capable to predict the production status and provide information for monitoring production performance thanks to the real-time locating system. Kunath and Winkler (2018) state that only a few companies are using technologies for the identification and localization of products, machines, and especially works from the perspective of enterprise application.
2.3. Knowledge graph in manufacturing
Aiming at the demand matching problems, Yin et al. (2021) study the construction method of knowledge graph of manufacturing resources in the cloud manufacturing environment. Zheng et al. (2021) establish industrial knowledge graph and graph-embedding techniques for selfconfigurable cognitive manufacturing networks, knowledge is extracted from multimodal data, and the task is decomposed in a sematicbased manner. He and Jiang (2019) construct an ontology-based manufacturing knowledge graph to capture and integrate multifactor and multilevel knowledge hidden in manufacturing enterprises. A score function is established to evaluate entity semantic matching in the solution recommendation phase. As much manufacturing information is unstructured and informal textual contents in documents, which are difficult to analyse and not ready for supporting decisions, Zhou et al. (2021) propose an industrial tabular information extraction and its semantic fusion with text approach to integrate tabular information and construct a tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph. Guo et al. (2022) introduce an automatic construction framework for the process knowledge base in the field of machining based on the knowledge graph. The processed text is extracted automatically based on LSTM neural network. The industrial knowledge graph has become an integral element in Siemens’ digitalization strategy towards intelligent engineering and manufacturing, and also support the easy integration of multiple data sources and to provide a formal semantic representation to enable inference and machine processing (Hubauer et al., 2018). Bao et al. (2022) proposed a generic node2vecbased parametrized representation method of geometric elements and topological relationships in assembly for predicting the execution time of assembly workshop. The quality problem-solving is an important process to ensure product quality, Xu and Dang (2021) develop a twostage clustering method to discover solution knowledge from quality data. Even the rough knowledge can also be leveraged for predicting the manufacturing quality through a reinforcement learning framework (Bai et al., 2021). Hao et al. (2021) exploit the knowledge graph method for structuring and navigating decision-related knowledge in the design of engineered systems. D. Zhang et al. (2021) point out that PL resource allocation based on knowledge graph is one of the key research directions for the application prospects of knowledge graph in the field of intelligent manufacturing.
2.4. Summary of literature
Current resource management focuses on the production stage. The considerations for the production stage are mainly capacity, delivery
time, sudden orders., etc. The mobility of most production resources such as assembly lines, and machines is in a static state. Few studies consider the logistics and production logistics linkage stage where dynamics of PL resources in spatial–temporal perspective are often overlooked. Most digital twin research discuss specific and limited objects emphasizing on reflecting the individual’s internal characteristics (e.g. geometry, behavior, and rules) which are confined to a certain geographic area. The scattered, massive, and heterogeneous PL resources move frequently and freely between production lines and factory areas, which increases the difficulty and complexity of all-weather mapping as specific techniques required in indoor tracking. The research of digital twin modelling of spatial–temporal consistency on large-scale physical and mapped virtual replica is still in its infancy. The knowledge graph theory is conducive to reasoning implicit semantic information for completion of the knowledge network and offering personalized recommendations. In the manufacturing domain, efforts have been paid on picturing the industry knowledge and providing suggestions. However, there is limited research on how to adopt graph algorithms for decisionmaking in PL operations. Therefore, how to integrate PL operation information into knowledge graph for allocating resources deserves more attention.
3. Dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph architecture
To tackle the preceding challenges, the four-layer architecture of DSTKG-based PL resources allocation is proposed in Fig. 1. We first establish a smart IoT-enabled environment in the industrial park for both outdoor and indoor scenarios to collect the real-time dynamic spatial–temporal implied data. This layer in physical space serves as a technical pillar to pave the way for the cyber space analytics. The digital twin spatial–temporal mapping, dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph modelling, and graph algorithm-based PL resources allocation decision making in cyber space provide the step-by-step answer to the research questions. (1) Mobile PL resources in IoT enabled smart environment. In the industrial park, the successful execution of PL operation requires the movement of the PL resources carrying materials and WIPs back and forth between the production lines and workshops. The PL resources including personnel, vehicles, and materials are difficult to be tracked due to the high mobility and unpredictability. Even though the GPS and BDS can achieve the outdoor positioning with satisfying results, most of the PL operations take place in indoor multi-level environments where the satellite-based positioning does not work. In the bottom layer, PL resources are highlighted in both outdoor and indoor environments in the industrial park. IoT Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tag is attached to the mobile PL resources in various portable forms which emits the signals constantly based on configured frequency. The gateways deployed at fixed locations with specific coordinates receive the signals broadcasted from the BLE tag. To take full advantage of edge computing capabilities, the gateway conducts signal processing methods to filter noise data and compress it before sending it to the cloud server. (2) Digital twin spatial–temporal mapping. The objective of this layer is to obtain spatial–temporal information through IoT-generated signal data, which provides the mapping of the PL resources from the physical world to the cyber world with correct spatial–temporal representation. To ensure the spatial–temporal consistency between physical space and cyber space, the deep neural network is leveraged to output the location information in the cyber space. Based on the physical entity of PL resources in the physical space, virtual replicas of the PL resources with spatial–temporal values are generated through the deep learning method. Due to the multipath and attenuation effect, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) acquired by the gateway was filled with noises and fluctuations. Kalman Filter is one of the most widely used methods for data de-noising. The raw RSSI readings collected from multiple gateways are filtered via Kalman Filter. Supervised learning requires datasets as input for training the non-linear

model. The onsite environment including walls, obstacles, and temperature/humidity has effects on the signal strength. The signal fingerprint database is established for training datasets with corresponding RSSI readings and location labels that reflect the onsite environment information. To guarantee reliability and persistence of spatial information estimation, the deep neural network is supposed to be updated according to the environment adjustment. Corrected online spatial information estimation will be fed back to the model for calibrating parameters and weights in the neural networks. (3) Dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph modelling. A knowledge graph is a heterogeneous graph, where vertices denote entities, and edges represent relations between entities. PL resources and their attributes including spatial–temporal information can be mapped into the knowledge graph not only to represent the exact geographical distribution but also the mutual relations between them. The ontologybased PL resources knowledge is represented, and the entities of PL resources are mapped on the graph with attributes. The relevant PL resources are extracted from PL tasks to form the relation between entities. The relationship reasoning and completion in the knowledge graph is conducted based on the logic of the PL task and the sequential coupling of PL resources. The directed knowledge graph is then established. The knowledge graph provides an intuitive representation of resources’ spatial–temporal values. With the spatial–temporal information generated from the below layer, the spatial–temporal fusion contributes to the generation of the dynamic spatial–temporal knowledge graph. Vertices in the knowledge graph are deployed based on the true coordinates in the real-life world and edges represent the logical relationship between the entities. The visible spatial–temporal consistency between the physical entity and virtual replica is realized through knowledge graph modelling. (4) Graph algorithm-based PL resources allocation decision making. To allocate the PL resources according to PL tasks properly, this layer conduct graph algorithm-based decision-making for PL resources allocation. The constraints such as time window and transport capacity have
been taken into consideration when generating the weights on the edges generated from the below layer. The values of the weights are calculated by the Euclidean distance. A directed and weighted knowledge graph is further established. It is noteworthy that the PL task extraction stands on the destination perspective which refers to the direction of the edges starting from the ending point of the transportation to the task performer. The resource allocation problem is therefore transformed into a single-source shortest path problem under the constraint of the time window and transport capacity. The objective of the function is to minimize the transport distance to conduct the PL task which utilizes the nearest idle resources. Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is utilized to calculate the shortest path. The path is then reversed to acquire the resources allocation direction.

4.1. Deep neural network for digital twin spatial–temporal consistent mapping
The estimation of the PL resource spatial information is complicated as they are located in multi-level indoor environments where the satellite positioning system cannot work properly. In this subsection, we propose a deep neural network for the estimation of the real-time PL resource spatial information. The indoor positioning methods such as AOA, TDOA, and TOA have achieved satisfying results, however, additional hardware is required which may result in high cost considering large-scale deployment. The RSSI is ubiquitous in wireless equipment which is a measurement index of signal strength from the emitter to the receiver without requiring extra supportive hardware. In this work, we adopt the RSSI values as the main features for spatial information estimation. Fig. 2 shows the preliminary deployment and data flow (see Fig. 3). As can be seen from the figure, mobile PL resources such as personnel, vehicles, and materials are equipped with IoT BLE tags that broadcast Bluetooth signals based on an adjustable frequency. Gateways, which are the microcomputer embedded with the BLE communication module, deploy at fixed positions in the indoor area with power supply and network support. The gateways continuously receive the nearby Bluetooth signals emitted from the BLE tags. In virtue of edge computing, the gateway is capable of conducting basic noise filtration methods such as Kalman Filter and its variations which helps to alleviate

computing pressure for the cloud server. The deep neural network is deployed in the cloud server which holds all the sensing data collected from the IoT devices. Fingerprinting method gains popularity recently due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and accuracy. We leverage the concept of fingerprinting method to train the deep neural network for the multiclassification model. The traditional fingerprint method includes two phases: offline and online. During the offline phases, sampling RSSI data with the correct labels at different reference points are obtained to create a radio map. The online process matches the real-time measurements with the most similar signal patterns on the radio map according to the Euclidean distance. However, the on-site environment of PL is complicated and changing at any time. The signal pattern at different reference points keeps changing but lack timely updates on the radio map. The obsolete radio map may lead to inaccurate location estimation. The deep neural network exhibits state-of-the-art performance in many fields where the big dataset is used in training. In this research, the deep neural network is employed due to its ability to approximate complex non-linear models being capable of mitigating the undesirable effects of wireless propagation. We consider a typical Bluetooth positioning scenario of K connected gateways deployed at the factory and M tags with broadcasting ability. The indoor map of the onsite scenario is divided into location cells, marked by LC = {1, 2, ⋯, C, C∊R}, where C is the total number of location cells in the factory including multiple indoor sites. During the offline phase, a set of RSSI values from K gateways is collected at different location cells:
ri = [r1
i , r2
i , r3
i ⋯, rK
i
]T , i = 1, 2, ⋯C, C ∈ R (1)
where rik denotes the RSSI values collected from the gateway k at the location cell i. We form a triplet (ri, Si, Ti) as training examples to the model where Si is the semantic spatial information of the location cell i and Ti is the timestamp of the collected RSSI value in location cell i. The centroids of the location cell have absolute coordinates for Euclidean distance calculation. During the online phase, the IoT BLE tag on the PL resources automatically sends signals to nearby gateways. The gateways receive and send the package data to the model in the cloud server for classification purpose. A set of RSSI values ̂x collected at timestamp T from all the
gateways at unknown spatial location ̂y is generated where ̂x ∈ RK, RK is denoted as the size of the vector ̂x and K is the total number of gateways. In the input layer, xk is the RSSI value from gateway k, we set 100 if the gateway has not received the signal emitted from the BLE tag. The neuron in the hidden layer l is described as a a[l]. The vectorization value of the hidden unit is described as follows:
A[l] = g[l] W[l]A[l 1] ) + b[l] (2)
where W[l] is the matrix of weights that represents all the synaptic connections between each unit from layer l 1 to layer l, b[l] is the bias
vector of layer l. g[l] represents the activation function such as sigmoid or ReLU in layer l. A[l 1] represents the output from the previous layer. In this architecture, we use ReLU as activation function.
g(z) = Max(0, z) (3)
Aiming at solving the multi-classification problem, we adopt the softmax function at output layer L in the form of vectorization as follows,
̂y =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
y1
y2
⋮
yC
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ (4)
The neuron in the output layer is calculated as:
A[L] = g(W[L]A[L 1] + b[L]) (5)
yi = p yi|A[L] ) = eA[L]
i
ΣC
s=1 eA[L]
s
(6)
where A[L] denotes the activation value in output layer L. yi represents the probability of location estimation in location cell i. Before the online prediction of spatial information estimation, parameters of the deep neural networks must be trained to learn the relationship between backand-forth layers. Considering the triplets we have established at the offline phase, the first two elements in all triplets (i.e. RSSI values and corresponding location cell indexes) serve as the total m training set (X, Y) for supervised learning. The timestamp only acts as a parameter that will be transferred to the results. The loss function quantifies the amount by which the prediction deviates from the desired values. The categorical cross-entropy loss function for softmax is defined as:
L(y, ̂y) =
∑C
i=1yiloĝyi (7)
where yi represents the actual value of the corresponding one hot encoded vector of y in location cell i. The backward propagation is conducted to update the model’s parameters which are presented in algorithm 1.
The regularization part is not considered as the overfitting issue is not significant. The trained parameters are used for the prediction of online measurements for the multi-classification problem. We then mark the spatial information on the knowledge graph.
4.2. DSTKG modelling and resource allocation decision-making
Fig. 4 depicts the steps of how to adopt the DSTKG for allocating the PL resources. The entity of PL resources including its basic properties is first represented in the knowledge graph as vertices with different categories. There is a total of four categories involved in PL operations including personnel, vehicle, product, and site in Fig. 5. The personnel

Computers & Industrial Engineering 171 (2022) 108454

knowledge includes several entities such as drivers for operating the vehicles, operators for operating specific machines, and technicians with specific skills, to name a few. The vehicles are responsible for transferring goods from site to site. Material, tool, component, and WIP products are included in the product category. The site category which
consists of buffers and stations is the starting or ending point for the PL operations. The properties in the property layer are related to each entity in the knowledge graph for constraints description, spatial–temporal calculations, and decision-making. Every PL task contains sematic information about transferring personnel/products to the specific site. The unstructured PL task data is stored in the task requirement property of the site entity. Module-based relationship extraction is adopted to plot directed edges from site to required entities(vertices). The knowledge graph with basic vertices and edges is established. The spatial–temporal estimation values acquired in Section 3 are then aligned to the entities in the graph. The property of spatial coordinates and timestamps in the entity is dynamically and synchronisingly updated to the graph database and represented in the geospatial system plotted in Fig. 4 step 2. A successfully executed PL operation often requires various PL resources sequential coupling such as a driver first needs to find the forklift and then pick up the required materials before heading to the warehouse. The purpose of the PL resources relationship reasoning completion part is to correctly express all the associated resources and corresponding costs involved in the completion of PL tasks through a directed and weighted graph. Fig. 6 illustrates a different perspective of how PL resources reasoning and relationship completion. The PL task requirement generated from the site entity is backpropagated. The relationship created from site to material will propagate the task requirement property to the material entity. The material entity then analyzes the task requirement and deduces next-level requirements and so on. The Euclidean distance is calculated and marked as the relationship cost between entities. Relationship completion will traverse all possibilities of successfully conducting the PL task. The DSTKG is then established and represented as DSTKG(V, E) where V refers to collections of vertices v and E denotes the collection of edges e with weights. The directed edges from the requirement perspective start from the site entity to the last executive unit. The execution perspective can be obtained by simply reversing the directed edges. The objective of the PL resource allocation is to allocate the most cost-effective resource to conduct a series of PL operations constrained by time window and capacity based on geospatial information. Therefore, we turn the PL logistics resources allocation problem into the single-source shortest pathfinding problem under certain constraints. Dijkstra in graph algorithm is adopted as all the weights are nonnegative. We maintain a set R of vertices for which distance is already set correctly. The first vertex added to R is site entity S. On each itera
tion, we take a vertex outside of R with the minimal distance value, add it to R, and relax all its outgoing edges. The following algorithm 2 illustrates the detailed steps for finding the shortest path from the site to the last executive unit.
In algorithm 2, all vertices, edges with weights in DSTKG established, and sources (site entity) are the input to the algorithm. The distance from source to other vertices is set to the infinite and the previous vertex in the optimal path from sources is set to undefine during the initialization phase. All the unoptimized vertices in the DSTKG are put in Q. While the Q is not empty, the distance value of all outgoing edges from the source is calculated based on the weights. The vertex u with minimum distance is selected as visiting one and removed from Q. For each neighbour v of u. The relaxation is conducted. The Euclidean distance divides the velocity of PL resource can get the duration to determine whether the arrival time is still within the time window. The optimal path is recorded and calculated in the prev[], dist[] respectively. The reverse of the optimal path is the execution perspective with the correct cost. It first takes O(V) time to construct the initial priority queue of |V|. With the adjacency list, all vertices in DSTKG can be traversed through edges which takes O(E) time. Each iteration of the loop is O(V) as the vertex is removed from Q per loop. The minimum vertex is extracted from Q and updated in O(logV) time.

5. Case study
An air conditioner manufacturing company located in the Great Bay Area of China whose PL is currently encountering difficulties, especially the low efficiency of monitoring and allocating the resource. Their main business covers residential air conditioners, central air conditioners, intelligent equipment, and home appliance. Considering the discrete manufacturing type, an industrial park was established for better cooperation among different parties. Some of the upstream and downstream suppliers were also invited to enter the industrial park for better collaboration and delivery cost reduction. Plants such as central airconditioning plants, evaporators, and condenser plants are built multilevel in the indoor environment with assembly lines and equipment. The parking area and injection area are outdoor or semi-outdoor for better ventilation. Fig. 7 shows an aerial view of the industrial park and onsite scenario. Outdoor, indoor, and semi-indoor environments exist which makes the spatial–temporal estimation disjoint and complicated. Mobile PL resources including personnel, material trolleys, forklifts, various materials, WIP, and products are dispersed around the industrial park. The solution of digitalization and intelligent transformation is in urgent need. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed

DSTKG, the research team developed and deployed the total hardware and software solution in the collaborating company.
5.1. Deployment of DSTKG
To deploy the DSTKG, the IoT smart environment is supposed to be first established for collecting and pre-filtering the real-time spatial–temporal data. Various technologies on the market for large-scale tracking are investigated by the research team. The large-scale has
double-folded meanings, one is the tracking area is a large floor space instead of a lab testbed environment, and the other one is the tracking objects are massive rather than positioning or navigating research through a single smartphone. The large-scale deployment also brings challenges to maintenance if the battery duration of the smart technologies is too short. In this case, the accuracy, cost of the tag/gateway, and duration are of great importance to consider. The BLE technology is a compromise approach that has low cost on tag and gateways, a relatively long duration of up to 3 years, and meter-level accuracy.

As can be seen from Fig. 8, the gateway is deployed in the fixed location, usually close to the power supplier. The location cell is therefore recorded. BLE tags, with different carrying types, are paired with mobile PL resources such as material trolleys, forklifts, and personnel. There is a total of 232 personnel, 520 vehicles, and 36 types of materials are equipped with BLE tags, and 96 gateways are deployed in different locations both indoor and outdoor environments respectively. The traditional fingerprinting signal collection strategy (TFSCS) requires all the tracking areas to be equally divided into the same location cells, which results in time-consuming and labour-intensive signal acquisition. A scalable location cell signal collection (SLCSC) strategy is adopted to minimize the collection effort by dynamically adjusting the location cell size. In places with high positioning accuracy requirements, such as indoor multi-layer environments where PL resources frequently travel through, the location cell is reduced to obtain
more accurate positioning results. However, in places with low positioning accuracy requirements, such as outdoor environments where PL resources are rarely visited, the location cell is expanded to reduce the signal collection effort. Fig. 9 depicts a generated DSTKG triggered by an illustrative PL task in level 1 of the indoor central air-conditioning plant. We use Gephi, a graph visualization platform to picture the DSTKG. The orange-coloured entity denotes the resource demander where the relevant materials and personnel are supposed to head to. The blue-coloured entity refers to the material. In this case, only one material is required. Vehicles and personnel are represented as purple and green respectively. The directed cyan edges with Euclidean distance as weights illustrate the PL task execution sequence in reverse order assuming all the possibilities. All the entities in the graph are located based on the spatial–temporal coordinates generated by the deep neural networks. The DSTKG has

become a form of expression of digital twins which realizes the spatial–temporal consistency between the physical entity and virtual entity. To guarantee the delivery of PL resources falls in the time window, the arrival time can be calculated simply by dividing the distance by the velocity.
5.2. Result analysis
There are a total of 96 gateways deployed at the industrial park. The neurons of the input layer are equal to the number of gateways. The input vector is denoted by ̂x = [r1, r2, r3⋯, r96]T where ri refers to the
RSSI value received from i th gateway. The unreachable gateways give a 100 value for construing the input vector. The output layer is a multiclassifier with neurons’ numbers equal to location cells. In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F-score is a measure of a test’s accuracy. It is calculated from the precision and recall of the test, where the precision is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including those not identified correctly, and the recall is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all samples that should have been identified as positive. Macro F1-score is used to assess the quality of problems with multiple classes. To look for the high accuracy and quick spatial–temporal

estimation, different neural network configurations are performed in Table 1. The training and validation datasets from radio map construction are divided according to the ratio of 8:2. Neural network 1 has a short processing time however the precision is lower than the other three configurations. The neural network 4 has reached the best precision however the recall is low due to the reason of overfitting and long processing time. Neural network 2 and 3 has satisfying results. The timely spatial–temporal value estimation contributes to the real-time decision-making, therefore configuration 2 has been selected due to the short processing time. Figure 10 demonstrates the information of DSTKG performance. We first apply the tracking to the PL resources before allocating them based on the graph algorithm. As can be seen in Fig. 10(a), during the training data set preparation, compared to TFOSC, the signal collection time in SLCSC is significantly reduced at FBA, IBW, and ECP due to lower accuracy requirements. A significant increase in vehicle utilization rate is
observed in Fig. 10(b) as the DSTKG can identify the whereabouts of each vehicle and feed it into the model for decision making. The logistics and M/WIP buffer before and after the site are the area where the temporal asynchrony is most evident. The third subgraph in Fig. 10 depicts the comparison before and after the use of DSTKG, the waiting time at both buffers is lowered obviously. Dijkstra-based graph algorithm contributes to finding the shortest path for PL task, the average travelling distance for different resources has been considerably reduced.
5.3. Managerial implications
Manufacturing managers tend to focus on the productivity improvements in the production stage while ignoring the PL efficiency. The present study also provides several practical implications and valuable lessons for manufacturers to manage PL operations. First, it is necessary to acquire the spatial–temporal value of mobile PL resources through the digital twin. We explored how the digital twin can affect PL operations. The spatial–temporal replica can synchronously and intuitively express the status, proximate neighbours, and trajectories of PL physical resources. Due to disorderly parking and delayed recycling, the locationunseen and untraceable vehicles are usually often neglected during the following operations, which renders a low utilization rate. Our research findings show that the real-time location information of the mobile PL resources contributes to improving the utilization rate. Second, the PL travelling distance optimization matters. The PL process occupies 95% of the total production time as the transferring of materials/WIPs from site to site. Severe congestion occurs at the logistics buffer and M/WIP buffer is only superficial, the fundamental reason is the irrational allocation of PL resources which causes unnecessary long travelling distances. A successful PL task is conducted by sequential coupling of various kinds of PL resources. The travelling distance of each

section affects the overall efficiency of PL. This research shows the cruciality of geospatial visualization and calculation of PL operations. Extending location-based services from personal applications to the manufacturing industry helps provide geospatial-related data support for optimization decisions.
6. Conclusion
The spatial disorder and temporal asynchrony of the PL resources due to the uncertainty and dynamicity pose great challenges to efficient resource allocation, especially in large-scale environments. The chaos in logistics and M/WIP buffer seriously hampers manufacturers’ sustainable development. This research develops a solution from obtaining the spatial–temporal values of resources to the reasoning and representation of associated PL operations, and then to the optimal allocation of resources. The feasibility and effectiveness are verified in a real-life airconditioner manufacturing large-scale industrial park. This paper makes contributions not only to the scientific literature on digital twin in the domain of production logistics but also practically to the knowledge graph for resource allocation in the industrial sector. Firstly, the digital twin spatial–temporal mapping of mobile PL resources is achieved through the deep neural network. The spatial–temporal value of the resources is estimated through featured IoT signal data. Secondly, the DSTKG model we proposed not only conducts knowledge extraction and relationship reasoning from PL resources and its related operations but also represents the digital twin virtual entities for spatial–temporal visualization. A directed and weighted graph is established by completing edge reasoning and calculating geospatialrelated information. Thirdly, the Dijkstra-based graph algorithm, considering geospatial relations and constraints such as time windows and capacity simultaneously, is proposed to minimize the total travelling distance at each stage during the sequential coupling of PL resources. However, the proposed DSTKG for PL resources allocation still has some limitations. The first limitation is the deep neural networks for spatial–temporal values estimation require heavy computation capacity, especially in large-scale deployment, which may affect real-time decision making. The change of gateway numbers may affect the input features of the deep neural network. Another limitation is the performance evaluation indexes should be designed from more perspectives. The consumption of energy of PL resources during operations should be taken into consideration. In the future, this research will introduce more synchronization methods to allocate PL resources by altering the objective from timely delivery to synchronous delivery. Besides, some fixed-position assembly islands will be considered as one particular kind of PL resource for allocation. Future research could extend our analysis to an overlapping coarse–fine method of offline signal fingerprint database construction in large-scale scenarios. Transfer learning can be explored when adjusting new positioning areas. Expanding the proposed resource allocation model by including the dynamic disturbance on the PL tasks will obtain more realistic outcomes. Finally, future research endeavours should investigate the heuristics pathfinding solutions for resource allocation to improve real-timeliness.
